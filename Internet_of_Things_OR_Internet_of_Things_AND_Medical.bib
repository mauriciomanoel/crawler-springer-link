abstract="As a kind of medical service around people, community health care is closely related to peoples lives, and thus it has also been placed higher requirements. In the face of growing community medical needs, the construction and development of community medical Internet of things is imminent. Subsequently, massive multi-type of medical data which contain all kinds of user identity data, various types of vital signs data and other sensitive information are generated. Such a large scale of data in the transmission, storage and access process is facing the risk of data leakage. To effectively protect the privacy information of patients, an infrastructure framework for privacy protection of community medical Internet of things is proposed. It includes transmission protection based on multi-path asymmetric encryption fragment transmission mechanism, storage protection using distributed symmetric encryption cloud storage scheme and access control with identity authentication and dynamic access authorization. Through theoretical analysis and simulation experiments, it is proved that the community medical data can be effectively protected.",

In this paper, we expose each object capabilities as a web service and propose a resource-oriented service publishing method for devices in IoT. With the proposed ontology-based resource description model, various objects are abstracted as basic resources with multidimensional attributes. The basic resources are further combined into more complex resources to support practical business functions. All the resources will be published by the representational state transfer interface.

abstract="Recently, research on cloud-integrated Internet of Things where an Internet of Things (IoT) is converged with a cloud environment has been actively pursued. An IoT operates through interaction among many composition elements, such as actuators and sensors. At present, IoTs are used in diverse areas (for example, traffic control and safety, energy savings, process control, communications systems, distributed robots, and other important applications). In daily life, IoTs should provide services of high reliability corresponding with various physical elements. In order to guarantee highly reliable IoT services, optimized modeling, simulation, and resource management technologies integrating physical elements and computing elements are required. For such reasons, many systems are being developed where autonomic computing technologies are applied that sense any internal errors or external environmental changes occurring during system operation and where systems adapt or evolve themselves. In an IoT environment composed of large-scale nodes, autonomic computing requires a high processing amount and efficient storage processing of computing in order to process sensing data efficiently. In addition, due to the heterogeneous composition of IoT environments, separate middleware is required to share collected information. Accordingly, this paper proposed an efficient resource management scheme (ERMS) that efficiently manages IoT resources using cloud infrastructure satisfying the high availability, expansion, and high processing amount requirements. ERMS provides a XML-based standard sensing data storage scheme in order to store and process heterogeneous IoT sensing data in the cloud infrastructure. In addition, ERMS provides classification techniques to efficiently store and process distributed IoT data.",

abstract="Managing privacy in the IoT presents a significant challenge. We make the case that information obtained by auditing the flows of data can assist in demonstrating that the systems handling personal data satisfy regulatory and user requirements. Thus, components handling personal data should be audited to demonstrate that their actions comply with all such policies and requirements. A valuable side-effect of this approach is that such an auditing process will highlight areas where technical enforcement has been incompletely or incorrectly specified. There is a clear role for technical assistance in aligning privacy policy enforcement mechanisms with data protection regulations. The first step necessary in producing technology to accomplish this alignment is to gather evidence of data flows. We describe our work producing, representing and querying audit data and discuss outstanding challenges.",

abstract="In the era of Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, Secured information transfer is necessitated between mobile and internet based services in IoT environments. As IoT environment connected to heterogeneous network, they become vulnerable to attacks and hence it is required for secured mechanism for data transfer. Moreover, when secured cryptographic algorithms are employed in mobile phones, battery consumption plays a major role. The IoT environment associated with proposed algorithm can be used to interlink humans and enable the use of a communication channel to bring forth inter machine interaction. The encryption procedures used here makes sure that the major concerns of authentication uniqueness, confidentiality and privacy of the users are maintained. This implies that the users and the service providers can implement the system security measures that have been proposed. Research is still being conducted to improve the architecture and implementation strategies in a real time environment. In order to solve those issues, this paper proposes a novel scalar point-multiplication which gives low energy consumed snippet based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) that provides same level of security and also keeps low energy consumption by speeding up the computation time. The performance evaluation with the key size of 14 and 16 bits reveals that the proposed algorithm can be fast and saves the battery life than the other conventional ECC algorithms.",

High efficiency video coding (HEVC) is the state-of-the-art video coding technology that can provide powerful video compression performance under limited bandwidth conditions for transmission or storage. Although HEVC adopted newly advanced video coding tools to achieve a bitrate reduction of 50{\%} with similar video quality compared to the previous method, H.264/AVC, these cause heavy computational encoding complexity resulting from inter prediction process of HEVC encoder. In this paper, we propose a complexity scalable SKIP/MERGE encoding algorithm to design a low complexity inter prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed method is much faster than those of HEVC test model (47.42{\%}) and previous method (13.95{\%}) in terms of total encoding time, on average.",

abstract="IoT connects devices, humans, places, and even abstract items like events. Driven by smart sensors, powerful embedded microelectronics, high-speed connectivity and the standards of the internet, IoT is on the brink of disrupting today's value chains. Big Data, characterized by high volume, high velocity and a high variety of formats, is a result of and also a driving force for IoT. The datafication of business presents completely new opportunities and risks. To hedge the technical risks posed by the interaction between ``everything'', IoT requires comprehensive modelling tools. Furthermore, new IT platforms and architectures are necessary to process and store the unprecedented flow of structured and unstructured, repetitive and non-repetitive data in real-time. In the end, only powerful analytic tools are able to extract ``sense'' from the exponentially growing amount of data and, as a consequence, data science becomes a strategic asset. The era of IoT relies heavily on standards for technologies which guarantee the interoperability of everything. This paper outlines some fundamental standardization activities. Big Data approaches for real-time processing are outlined and tools for analytics are addressed. As consequence, IoT is a (fast) evolutionary process whose success in penetrating all dimensions of life heavily depends on close cooperation between standardization organizations, open source communities and IT experts.",

abstract="Pavement image segmentation needs to deal with noise spots and has real time requirement. The original FCM method only considers the pixel's gray value and doesn't fully utilize the spatial information of the image. A new fast FCM algorithm is proposed, and it has noise immunity. By comparing with other FCM algorithms, it achieves better segmentation results through less iteration times and more rapid runtime. It is an effective and noise-resistant algorithm for pavement image segmentation from video multimedia in IOT (internet of things) platform.",

Traditional multi-sensor data fusion can deal with the same type of data effectively. However, as new characteristics emerge in the IoT, interoperable service-oriented technologies are required to share real-world data among heterogeneous devices to integrate and fuse the multi-source heterogeneous IoT data. To address these issues, an architecture that can provide guidance for the development of IoT information fusion is required. We compare features of IoT data and information with an existing wireless sensor network and the Internet, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first comparison of this kind. Then, we design a framework for multi-source heterogeneous information fusion in the IoT and use an experimental simulation platform to build an environmental monitoring system to assess the framework.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) enables producers of context data like sensors to interact with remote consumers of context data like smart pervasive applications in an entirely decoupled way. However, two important issues are faced by context data distribution, namely providing context information with a sufficient level of quality---i.e. quality of context (QoC)---while preserving the privacy of context owners. This article presents the solutions provided by the INCOME middleware framework for addressing these two potentially contradictory issues while hiding the complexity of context data distribution in heterogeneous and large-scale environments. Context producers and consumers not only express their needs in context contracts but also the guarantees they are ready to fulfil. These contracts are then translated into advertisement and subscription filters to determine how to distribute context data. Our experiments on a first open source prototype show that QoC-based filtering and privacy protection using attributed-based access control can be performed at a reasonable cost.",

A landslide occurred in the filling body of the eastern part of the Panzhihua airport on October 3, 2009 (hereafter called the 10.3 landslide). We conducted field survey on the landslide and adopted emergency monitoring and warning models based on the Internet of Things (IoT) to estimate the losses from the disaster and to prevent a secondary disaster from occurring. The results showed that four major features of the airport site had contributed to the landslide, i.e, high altitude, huge amount of filling rocks, deep backfilling and great difficulty of backfilling. The deformation process of the landslide had six stages and the unstable geological structure of high fillings and an earthquake were the main causes of the landslide. We adopted relative displacement sensing technology and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology to achieve remote, real-time and unattended monitoring of ground cracks in the landslide. The monitoring system, including five extensometers with measuring ranges of 200, 450 and 700 mm, was continuously working for 17 months and released 7 warning signals with an average warning time of about 26 hours. At 10 am on 6 December 2009, the system issued a warning and on-site workers were evacuated and equipment protected immediately.

Frailty of old age, susceptibility to diseases, and impairments are inevitable issues that these senior adults need to deal with in daily life.

Internet of things (IoT), as an advanced paradigm to connect physical and virtual things for enhanced services, has been introduced that can provide significant improvements in remote elderly monitoring. Several efforts have been recently devoted to address elderly care requirements utilizing IoT-based systems. Nevertheless, there still exists a lack of user-centered study from an all-inclusive perspective for investigating the daily needs of senior adults. In this paper, we study the IoT-enabled systems tackling elderly monitoring to categorize the existing approaches from a new perspective and to introduce a hierarchical model for elderly-centered monitoring.

The major problems facing by blind people fall in the category of navigating through indoor and outdoor environments consisting of various obstacles and recognition of person in front of them. Identification of objects or person only with perceptive and audio information is difficult. An intelligent, portable, less expensive, self-contained navigation and face recognition system is highly demanded for blind people. This helps blind people to navigate with the help of a Smartphone, global positioning system (GPS) and a system equipped with ultrasonic sensors. Face recognition can be done using neural learning techniques with feature extraction and training modules. The images of friends, relatives are stored in the database of user Smartphone. Whenever a person comes in front of the blind user, the application with the help of neural network gives the voice aid to the user. Thus this system can replace the regular imprecise use of guide dogs as well as white sticks to help the navigation and face recognition process for people with impaired vision.In this paper, we have proposed a novel image recognition and navigation system which provides precise and quick messages in the form of audio to visually challenged people so that they can navigate easily.

These technologies are key technology of various ICT convergence services, and it will create a value-added business and market. Although it is in its infancy, there is no doubt that it will be a game changer. However, cloud computing technology and IoT technology have some limitations especially in openness and standardization because they have been independently evolved. This is why they expose some weak-points, which are difficult to expand to various services, and it also has some problems to interwork other devices or services. In the safe network case, current safe network service has a restriction because it is based on closed networks. In addition, the key technology in the safe networking has an independent scheme or architecture. Due to the fact that we need new architecture to integrate entire networks, there are no certain alternatives so far. It is because most of related works are focused on the providing to just the safety in the networks. To solve these problems, we propose a safe data transmission architecture for the IoT ecosystems. The proposed architecture is a kind of software defined network base cloud, and it can provide the safe data transmission with QoS/QoE. Basically, the proposed architecture has three states, install, start and working, and four phase, negotiation, initialization, configuration and execution. In the install state, the devices set some parameters such as a synchronization time between node in cloud and IoT device. Based on the install state, data transmission will be started in the start state. In the start state, the nodes start data transmission by the set parameters in the install state. And then, the nodes keep the working state. However, it can be changed whenever user's request to upgrade the transmission security. The proposed architecture has some enhanced synchronization algorithms to provide a safe data transmission and to guarantee a QoS/QoE. Based on the architecture, we verified that the proposed architecture outperforms than legacy architectures in various aspects, and we are shown these simulation results by using OPNET.",

In this paper, we present a novel scalable grouping proof protocol. Since scalability is a challenge in grouping proof protocol, to solve the scalability problem in the proposed protocol, the reader broadcasts the messages and the tags respond to it independently. In terms of the performance, we use a 64-bit lightweight Pseudo-Random Number Generator (64-PRNG) function, which meets the needs of low-power and low-cost systems. In addition, the security analysis results prove that the proposed protocol is resistant against RFID threats and provides an acceptable security level and low computation cost.",

IoT is an emerging concept, based on the convergence of legacy technologies, like RFID, WSN and smart objects, for connecting billions of ``things''. Such a massive connectivity generates a huge data for analysis, processing, mining and storage. Moreover, the inherent heterogeneity of IoT is also raising significant technical and application challenges. Many countries are innovating and adapting IoT for the development of the country's economy. Korea, being a digitally advanced country, is already ranked second in ``suitability of preparedness for IoT opportunities''. In this paper, we first mention the vision, capabilities and status of IoT. Next, we discuss the architectural requirements and popular global IoT projects. Subsequently, we review the history, research plans and applications of Korean IoT. Finally, our work concludes with a list of major open issues and challenges faced by the Korean IoT industry with pointers to possible solutions.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) can manage a large number of smart wireless devices and form a networking infrastructure connected to the Internet. Traditional batteries in IoT produce environmental concerns and have limited operational life. Harvesting and converting ambient environmental energy is an effective and important approach for sustainable green power used in wireless and portable devices in IoT. This contribution reviews the state-of-the-art development of different energy harvesting sources including mechanical, light/solar, wind, sound, RF, biomechanical and pyroelectric energy. Power density generated from ambient source ranges widely from 0.001 $\mu$W/cm2 (RF WiFi) to 100 mW/cm2 (outdoor solar). Depends on application areas and working principles, typical power consumptions of IoT sensor nodes are in the order of mW (1--750 mW) in active mode and $\mu$W (0--60 $\mu$W) in sleep mode (Mathna et al. in Talanta 75:613--623, 2008; Magno et al. in IEEE Trans Ind Electron 61:1871--1881, 2014; Baranov et al. in Sens Actuators A 233:279--289, 2015; Somov et al. in Procedia Eng 87:520--523, 2014; Spirjakin et al. in Sens Actuators A 247:247--253, 2016; Samson et al. in Sens Actuators A 172:240--244, 2011). Therefore, efficient energy storage and management strategies are important for IoT development. These parts are discussed in order to provide the sustainable power. MEMS based energy harvesting devices may be widely employed in various areas, such as military monitoring, remote weather station, bluetooth headsets, and environment detection. This review focuses on the low power and self powered IoT applications: sensors, wearables, and RF-MEMS. With the advance of nanofabrication techniques, IoT devices will become smaller and enter into the era of Internet of Nano-Things.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging global infrastructure that employs wireless sensors to collect, store, and exchange data. Increasingly, applications for marketing and advertising have been articulated as a means to enhance the consumer shopping experience, in addition to improving efficiency. However, privacy advocates have challenged the mass aggregation of personally-identifiable information in databases and geotracking, the use of location-based services to identify one's precise location over time. This paper employs the framework of contextual integrity related to privacy developed by Nissenbaum (Privacy in context: technology, policy, and the integrity of social life. Stanford University Press, Stanford, 2010) as a tool to understand citizen response to implementation IoT-related technology in the supermarket. The purpose of the study was to identify and understand specific changes in information practices brought about by the IoT that may be perceived as privacy violations. Citizens were interviewed, read a scenario of near-term IoT implementation, and were asked to reflect on changes in the key actors involved, information attributes, and principles of transmission. Areas where new practices may occur with the IoT were then highlighted as potential problems (privacy violations). Issues identified included the mining of medical data, invasive targeted advertising, and loss of autonomy through marketing profiles or personal affect monitoring. While there were numerous aspects deemed desirable by the participants, some developments appeared to tip the balance between consumer benefit and corporate gain. This surveillance power creates an imbalance between the consumer and the corporation that may also impact individual autonomy. The ethical dimensions of this problem are discussed.",

In this paper, a comprehensive IoT-based framework is presented for analyzing national integrity of defence personnel with consideration to his/her daily activities. As reported by investigating agencies of many countries, routinely engagements of defence personnel are one of the premier reasons for vulnerability to national defence through intentional and unintentional information outflow of defence secrets. The work presented in this research is focused on monitoring various activities of defence personnel to determine his/her integral behavior in daily life. Specifically, Integrity Index Value is defined for every defence personnel based on different social engagements, and activities for detecting the vulnerability to national security. In addition to this, a probabilistic decision tree based automated decision making is presented to aid defence officials in analyzing various activities of a defence personnel for his/her integrity assessment. In order to validate the proposed framework, three challenging data sets have been considered for experimental evaluation.

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is the next evolutionary paradigm of networking technologies that interconnects almost all the smart objects and intelligent sensors related to human activities, machineries, and environment. IoT technologies and Internet Protocol connectivity enable wide ranges of network devices to communicate irrespective of their resource capabilities and local networks. In order to provide seamless connectivity and interoperability, it is notable to maintain secure end-to-end (E2E) communication links in IoT. However, device constraints and the dynamic link creations make it challenging to use pre-shared keys for every secure E2E communication scenario in IoT. Variants of Host Identity Protocol (HIP) are adopted for constructing dynamic and secure E2E connections among the heterogeneous network devices with imbalanced resource profiles and less or no previous knowledge about each other. We propose a solution called collaborative HIP (CHIP) with an efficient key establishment component for the high resource-constrained devices in IoT. CHIP delegates the expensive cryptographic operations to the resource rich devices in the local networks. Finally, by providing quantitative performance evaluation and descriptive security analysis, we demonstrate the applicability of the key establishment in CHIP for the constrained IoT devices rather than the existing HIP variants.",

abstract="With the rapid development of the smart city and the Internet Plus-themed multi-network applications, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the data access center for the Internet of Things (DACIOT) to meet large-scale users' service requirements with low latency and high quality while sending service access requests. This paper first converts the problem of a large number of access requests to DACIOT into a distributed constraint optimization problem. Then, in order to address the optimization problem, a dynamic multi-constraint service-aware collaborative access algorithm is proposed based on dynamic load feedback from the access nodes, which can effectively reduce network congestion through load feedback and improve access performance. The algorithm firstly defines the dynamic context load sensing model, which is able to detect the load metrics of access clusters and assist access servers to work together to improve the availability of DACIOT, then it uses a heuristic falling search algorithm to search for the optimal resource on the basis of this model, after which it analyzes the convergence of the access algorithm. Experimental results show that the algorithm can effectively improve the rate of success, lower the network delay of access requests and reduce network jitter when accessing DACIOT.",

abstract="In internet of things (IoT) study, to determine that the location of an event is the key issue, realize that a target location in IoT is one of the research hotspots by using the multihop range-free method. Multihop range-free could obtain relatively reasonable location estimation in the isotropic network, however, during the practical application, it tends to be affected by various anisotropic factors such as the electromagnetic interference, barriers and network attack, which can significantly reduce its performance. In accordance with these problems faced by multihop range-free, this paper proposes a novel IoT localization method: location estimation-kernel partial least squares (LE-KPLS). First of all, this method uses kernel function to define the connectivity information (hop-counts) between nodes, then, the maximum covariance is used to guide and build the inter-node localization model, and then, this model and the hop-counts between the unknown nodes and beacons are used to estimate the coordinate of the unknown nodes. Compared to the existing methods, the LE-KPLS has a high localization precision, great stability and strong generalization performance, without having a high requirement of the number of beacons, and it can well adapt to numerous complicated environments.",

Thus, this research proposes a provenance technique to deal with these issues. The technique is based on associative rules and lexical chaining methodologies, which enable traceability through the identification of propagation routes of data and object-to-object communications. Through visualization tools, the proposed methodologies also enabled us to determine linkability and unlinkability between IoT devices in a network which further leads to mechanisms to check correctness in sensor data propagation.",

abstract="Wireless networking in the Internet of Things is a challenging problem because a huge amount of devices in a relatively small region need to be interconnected. Particularly, the carrier sensing multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) operation of IoT devices is not viable solution, since dense network leads to high channel contentions. Moreover, given an intensive network traffic load, long queues or even queue overflows are expected, which further deteriorates network performance. To address these issue, multichannel medium access is proposed and it attracts great attention recently. In this paper, we firstly establish models based on combinatorics theory to analyze the performance of dynamic multichannel medium access. Then, a Cross-layer Cooperative Multichannel Medium Access (CCMMA) is proposed to effectively avoid channel contentions by enabling neighboring devices to communicate on orthogonal channels. The CCMMA also introduces a routing-enhanced mechanism that enables relaying nodes to wake up intelligently if there is incoming traffic, that successfully mitigates delay and queue overflow problems caused by low-power operation of IoT devices. The performance of CCMMA is evaluated through extensive simulations. The results show that it provides significant improvement in terms of quality of service over existing solutions.",

abstract="The future of the Internet of Things (IoT) is the Collaborative Internet of Things (C-IoT) in which different IoT deployments collaborate to provide better services. For instance, in smart city scenarios, C-IoT will have the potential to provide immersive multimedia user-experiences based on content and context fusion, immersive multi-sensory environments, location-based and media internet technologies, and augmented reality. However, this future paradigm will only be possible if the right decisions can be made based on the analysis of huge volumes of collected data: i.e. if the dependability of C-IoT is ensured. To address this challenge, we studied a simplified view of a C-IoT architecture composed of devices using three different technologies that have enabled the existence of IoT (RFID, NFC and Beacons). However, our proposal could be extended to any other devices in the context of C-IoT. To enhance the dependability of C-IoT, we deploy statistical data analysis techniques to improve the quality of the data obtained from identification and sensing devices and to select the most reliable devices that provide trusted (i.e. non-faulty) data in order to support accurate decision-making.",

abstract="Internet of things (IoT) technologies are advancing rapidly and a wide range of physical networking alternatives, communication standards and platforms are introduced. However, due to differences in system requirements and resource constraints in devices, there exist variations in these technologies, standards, and platforms. Consequently, application silos are formed. In contrast to the freedom of choice attained by a range of options, the heterogeneity of the technologies is a critical interoperability challenge faced by IoT systems. Moreover, IoT is also limited to address new requirements that arise due to the nature of the majority of smart devices. These requirements, such as mobility and intermittent availability, are hardly satisfied by the current IoT technologies following the end-to-end model inherited from the Internet. This paper introduces a lightweight, distributed, and embedded service bus called LISA which follows a Node Centric Networking architecture. LISA is designed to provide interoperability for resource-constrained devices in IoT. It also enables a natural way of embracing the new IoT requirements, such as mobility and intermittent availability, through node centric networking. LISA provides a simple application programming interface for developers, hiding the variations in platform, protocol or physical network, thus facilitating interoperability in IoT systems. LISA is inspired by network on terminal architecture (NoTA), a service centric open architecture originated by Nokia Research Center. Our extensive experimental results show the efficiency and scalability of LISA in providing a lightweight interoperability for IoT systems.",

abstract="This paper proposes a novel registration and super-resolution jointed paradigm for medical images under the Internet of thing environment. In the medical image processing, the matching issue is one catches wide attention with the domain of research. Image registration technique can be divided into similarity measure, optimization, geometric transformation, and interpolation, etc. As the first essential clue of our model, we propose the novel registration algorithm based on energy feature extraction. Generally, the matching energy function by the similarity measurement and a penalty constitution is called the external force and endogenic force separately. The matching is an external force and endogenic force mutual competition, eventually achieves the balanced process. Furtherly, we integrate the game analysis and area feature selection to achieve the better image super-resolution mode through the pretreatment of the image to change the initial value, so as to achieve the purpose of improving the performance. Besides the algorithm level innovation, we integrate the GPU and the IOT to construct the hardware based implementation of the proposed medical image processing system. The latency of registers to read and write data across a GPU's entire storage system is minimal, it is private to each thread, and can only be accessed by its owning thread. For each thread, the local memory is also private and it is often used to deal with the problem of overflow register, reducing the buffer overflow caused by the entire application of a substantial decline in the possibility and shared memory is visible to all threads within the thread block. We then achieve the optimal integration of IOT and GPU. The experimental result proves the robustness of the method.",

For this, it is necessary to detect semantic collision, with a fairly reliable method to find many semantic collision and powerful enough to run in a reasonable time. Big data fusion in Internet of Thing represents today an important data quality challenge which leads to bad decision-making. This paper proposes and compares on real data effective fusion matching methods for automatic removing semantic collision of files based on names, working with Chinese texts or English texts, and the names of people or places, in East or in the West. After conducting a more complete classification of big data fusion than the usual classifications, we introduce several methods for big data fusion. Through a simple model, we highlight a global efficiency, accuracy and recover. We propose a new measuring mechanism between records, as well as rules for automatic big data fusion. Analyses made on Internet of Thing containing real data in western cities, and on a known standard Internet of Thing containing names of companies in the China, have shown better results than those of known methods, with a lesser complexity.",

Performance rank (PR) index is calculated for each mobile ambulance based on the medical capacity (b) of the mobile ambulance, the number of patients currently using the mobile ambulance (n), and the Euclidean distance from a neighboring mobile ambulance. The minimum PR index is considered as best ambulance to provide a service to the patient. Random waypoint mobility model is used to simulate the proposed IoT based healthcare monitoring system. The proposed energy efficient node selection algorithm is compared with various node selection algorithms such as cluster based routing protocol, workload-aware channel assignment algorithm and scenario-based clustering algorithm for performance evaluation. The packet delivery fraction, normalized routing load and average end-to-end delay are calculated to evaluate the performance of the proposed energy efficient node selection algorithm.

The Third Industrial Revolution (TIR) is underpinned by the integration or mass customization of services and/or goods. The benefits of real-time mass customization cannot be over-stated as goods and services become indistinguishable and are co-produced as ``ServGoods'', resulting in an overwhelming economic advantage to the industrialized countries where the consuming customers are at the same time the co-producing producers. Adding sensors to these ServGoods and letting them connect or communicate among themselves or with other ServGoods can result in an Internet of Things (i.e., connected ServGoods).

In the work proposed, we have discussed the manner in which the Internet-of-Things based Cloud centric architecture is used for predictive analysis of physical activities of the users in sustainable health centers. The architecture proposed is based on the embedded sensors of the equipment rather than using wearable sensors or Smartphone sensors to store the value of the basic health-related parameters. Cloud centric architecture is composed of a Cloud data center, Public cloud, Private cloud, and uses the XML Web services for secure and fast communication of information. The architecture proposed here is evaluated for its adoption, prediction analysis of physical activities, efficiency, and security. From the results obtained it can be seen that the overall response between the local database server and Cloud data center remains almost constant with the rise in the number of users. For prediction analysis, If the results collected in real time for the analysis of physical activities exceed any of the parameter limits of the defined threshold value then an alert is sent to the health care personnel. Security analysis also shows the effective encryption and decryption of information. The architecture presented is effective and reduces the proliferation of information. It is also suggested, that a person suffering from any of the diseases mentioned above can defer the onset of complications by doing regular physical activities.",

abstract="As medical technology has been developing, patients' information (medical information, disease information, etc.) has been diversely used in medical services so that patients' biometric information can be used for remote diagnosis and examinations. However, since the complexity and uncertainty of patient treatment have been increasing, doctors' burden due to hospital work has been also increasing. In the present paper, an analytic hierarchy process based patient information management scheme is proposed that can synchronize diverse medical devices used for patient treatment to hierarchically manage patients' disease information. The purpose of the proposed scheme is to analyze the correlations of medical devices used in medical treatment of patients to induce hierarchical management of patients' disease information through triangle fuzzy of pairwise comparison scales for medical treatment and efficiently perform not only hospital administrative work but also patients' disease analysis and treatment. In addition, using the patients' disease information collected through diverse medical devices, the proposed scheme improves the efficiency of patient treatment methods so that hospitals can calculate the importance of treatment standards in order to hierarchically identify treatment standards. Furthermore, since the proposed scheme enables efficiently selecting treatment methods for patients' diseases, it has a characteristic of being capable of efficiently improve the ambiguousness and inaccuracy of treatment judgments and treatment compared to existing disease treatment methods. According to the results of performance evaluation, the proposed scheme improved work efficiency by 11.9{\%} over existing techniques and reduced medical device administration costs by 10.9{\%}.

abstract="Rapid proliferation in state-of-the art technologies has revolutionized the medical market for providing urgent, effective and economical health facilities to aging society. In this context media (i.e., video) transmission is considered as a quite significant step during first hour of the emergency for presenting a big and better picture of the event. However, the energy hungry media transmission process and slow progress in battery technologies have become a major and serious problem for the evolution of video technology in medical internet of things (MIoT) or internet of medical things (IoMT). So, promoting Green (i.e., energy-efficient) transmission during voluminous and variable bit rate (VBR) video in MIoT is a challenging and crucial problem for researchers and engineers. Therefore, the need arose to conduct research on Green media transmission techniques to cater the need of upcoming wearable healthcare devices. Thus, this research contributes in two distinct ways; first, a novel and sustainable Green Media Transmission Algorithm (GMTA) is proposed, second, a mathematical model and architecture of Green MIoT are designed by considering a 8-min medical media stream named, `Navigation to the Uterine Horn, transection of the horn and re-anastomosis' to minimize transmission energy consumption in media-aware MIoT, and to develop feasible media transmission schedule for sensitive and urgent health information from physian to patients and vice vers through extremely power hungry natured wearable devices. The experimental results demonstrate that proposed GMTA saves energy up to 41{\%}, to serve the community.",

abstract="Current telehealth systems are used to improve the treatment of chronic diseases by collecting medical data at the patient and transferring them to a remote medical institution. Research shows that such medical practice can be substantially improved if the measured parameters are greater in number and of more diverse nature. Emerging consumer solutions for monitoring personal health and wellness, as well as various resources from domains like internet, telecommunications and smart living, can be used as possible sources for exploration of an individual's wider health context. It was our aim to design an internet of things solutions, which would combine these sources of information into context information, complementary to health data. An internet of things platform was designed and implemented and integration with an established e-health system was provided to enrich telehealth data with context information by aggregating and processing cross-domain inputs from various sources. The approach was validated on a use case scenario. The concept was tried in a scenario related to prevention and management of heart disease. The system's advanced graphic correlation features are expected to help physicians and patients identify true roots of health problems. Medical researchers are also expected to benefit from a deeper insight into complex cross-domain parameter dependencies that determine an individual's health.",

abstract="Radio frequency identification (RFID) has been successfully implemented in supply chain management, automated toll collection, and inventory control. The next implementation is expected to come in retail, with RFID embedded in products, on shelves, and at check-out points for value-added sales and post-purchase services. This vision of a pervasive and omnipresent technology has spurred considerable controversy due to privacy concerns and fears of an Orwellian surveillance society. At the moment, consumer-oriented RFID research is scarce and fragmented. This paper seeks to chart the RFID territory, address the research that is readily available, and conclude with a call for a more encompassing research agenda on RFID and consumers. Research on RFID is needed to better understand the various contexts RFID appear in, to inform policy-makers not familiar with the many challenges involved, and to make industries aware of the full range of consumer-critical issues in RFID development.",

pages="1357--1372",
abstract="Information Systems (ISs) have become one of the crucial tools for various organizations in managing and coordinating business processes. Now we are entering the era of the Internet of Things (IoT). IoT is a paradigm in which real-world physical things can be connected to the Internet and provide services through the computing devices attached. The IoT infrastructure is starting to be integrated with ISs thereby diminishing the boundaries between the physical world and the business IT systems. With the development of IoT technologies, the number of connected things and their available physical services are increasing rapidly. Thus, selecting an appropriate service that satisfies a user's requirements from such services becomes a time-consuming challenge. To address this issue, we propose a Physical Service Model (PSM) as a common conceptual model to describe heterogeneous IoT physical services. PSM contains three core concepts (device, resource, and service) and specifies their relationships. Based on the proposed PSM, we define three types of Quality of Service (QoS) attributes and rate candidate services according to user requirements. To dynamically rate QoS values and select an appropriate physical service, we propose a Physical Service Selection (PSS) method that takes a user preference and an absolute dominance relationship among physical services into account. Finally, experiments are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed method.",

abstract="The technology of IoT combined with medical systems is expected to support advanced medical services. However, unsolved security problems, such as misuse of medical devices, illegal access to the medical server and so on, make IoT-based medical systems not be applied widely. In addition, users have a high burden of computation to access Things for the explosive growth of IoT devices. Because medical information is critical and important, but users have a restricted computing power, IoT-based medical systems are required to provide secure and efficient authentication for users. In this paper, we propose a selective group authentication scheme using Shamir's threshold technique. The property of selectivity gives the right of choice to users to form a group which consists of things users select and access. And users can get an access authority for those Things at a time. Thus, our scheme provides an efficient user authentication for multiple Things and conditional access authority for safe IoT-based medical information system. To the best of our knowledge, our proposed scheme is the first in which selectivity is combined with group authentication in IoT environments.",

abstract="Rural India lacks easy access to health practitioners and medical centers, depending instead on community health workers. In these areas, common ailments that are easy to manage with medicines, often lead to medical escalations and even fatalities due to lack of awareness and delayed diagnosis. The introduction of wearable health devices has made it easier to monitor health conditions and to connect doctors and patients in urban areas. However, existing initiatives have not succeeded in providing adequate health monitoring to rural and low-literate patients, as current methods are expensive, require consistent connectivity and expect literate users. Our design considerations address these concerns by providing low-cost medical devices connected to a low-cost health platform, along with personalized guidance based on patient physiological parameters in local languages, and alerts to medical practitioners in case of emergencies. This patient-centric integrated healthcare system is designed to manage the overall health of villagers with real-time health monitoring of patients, to offer guidance on preventive care, and to increase health awareness and self-monitoring at an affordable price. This personalized health monitoring system addresses the health-related needs in remote and rural areas by (1) empowering health workers in monitoring of basic health conditions for rural patients in order to prevent escalations, (2) personalized feedback regarding nutrition, exercise, diet, preventive Ayurveda care and yoga postures based on vital parameters and (3) reporting of patient data to the patient's health center with emergency alerts to doctor and patient. The system supports community health workers in the diagnostic procedure, management, and reporting of rural patients, and functions well even with only intermittent access to Internet.",

abstract="In an earlier paper (Tien 2015), the author defined the concept of a servgood, which can be thought of as a physical good or product enveloped by a services-oriented layer that makes the good smarter or more adaptable and customizable for a particular use. Adding another layer of physical sensors could then enhance its smartness and intelligence, especially if it were to be connected with each other or with other servgoods through the Internet of Things. Such sensed servgoods are becoming the products of the future. Indeed, autonomous vehicles can be considered the exemplar servgoods of the future; it is about decision informatics and embraces the advanced technologies of sensing (i.e., Big Data), processing (i.e., real-time analytics), reacting (i.e., real-time decision-making), and learning (i.e., deep learning). Since autonomous vehicles constitute a huge quality-of-life disruption, it is also critical to consider its policy impact on privacy and security, regulations and standards, and liability and insurance. Finally, just as the Soviet Union inaugurated the space age on October 4, 1957, with the launch of Sputnik, the first man-made object to orbit the Earth, the U. S. has inaugurated an age of automata or autonomous vehicles that can be considered to be the U. S. Sputnik of servgoods, with the full support of the U. S. government, the U. S. auto industry, the U. S. electronic industry, and the U.S. higher educational enterprise.",

abstract="Drug compliance and adverse drug reactions (ADR) are two of the most important issues regarding patient safety throughout the worldwide healthcare sector. ADR prevalence is 6.7 {\%} throughout hospitals worldwide, with an international death rate of 0.32 {\%} of the total of the patients. This rate is even higher in Ambient Assisted Living environments, where 15 {\%} of the patients suffer clinically significant interactions due to patient non-compliance to drug dosage and schedule of intake in addition to suffering from polypharmacy. These instances increase with age and cause risks of drug interactions, adverse effects, and toxicity. However, with a tight follow-up of the drug treatment, complications of incorrect drug use can be reduced. For that purpose, we propose an innovative system based on the Internet of Things (IoT) for the drug identification and the monitoring of medication. IoT is applied to examine drugs in order to fulfill treatment, to detect harmful side effects of pharmaceutical excipients, allergies, liver/renal contradictions, and harmful side effects during pregnancy. The IoT design acknowledges that the aforementioned problems are worldwide so the solution supports several IoT identification technologies: barcode, Radio Frequency Identification, Near Field Communication, and a new solution developed for low-income countries based on IrDA in collaboration with the World Health Organization. These technologies are integrated in personal devices such as smart-phones, PDAs, PCs, and in our IoT-based personal healthcare device called Movital.",

abstract="The rising availability of Personal Health Devices (PHDs) capable of Personal Network Area (PAN) communication and the desire of keeping a high quality of life are the ingredients of the Connected Health vision. In parallel, a growing number of personal and portable devices, like smartphones and tablet computers, are becoming capable of taking the role of health gateway, that is, a data collector for the sensor PHDs. However, as the number of PHDs increase, the number of other peripherals connected in PAN also increases. Therefore, PHDs are now competing for medium access with other devices, decreasing the Quality of Service (QoS) of health applications in the PAN. In this article we present a reference architecture to prioritize PHD connections based on their state and requirements, creating a healthcare Smart Gateway. Healthcare context information is extracted by observing the traffic through the gateway. A standard-based approach was used to identify health traffic based on ISO/IEEE 11073 family of standards. A reference implementation was developed showing the relevance of the problem and how the proposed architecture can assist in the prioritization. The reference Smart Gateway solution was integrated with a Connected Health System for the Internet of Things, validating its use in a real case scenario.",

title="An IoT healthcare service model of a vehicle using implantable devices",
journal="Cluster Computing",

abstract="As IoT technologies have become more available, healthcare patients increasingly want to be provided with services at places other than hospitals or their homes. Most patients with implantable devices still visit hospitals, sometimes using a self-driving car or public transportation to obtain services. When an emergency situation develops for a patient in a vehicle lacking the means to address the crisis, the patient's life cannot help but be in danger. The present paper proposes an IoT healthcare service model that will enable patients with a medical sensor to be provided healthcare services in a vehicle installed with IoT devices. To solve problems in existing models that do not include electromagnetic interference-based (EMI) multiple property management and control, the proposed model involves medical sensors with different multiple-property information guarantee targeted SINRs and minimum blackouts. The model also features the ability to connect to hospital healthcare service centers using the IoT devices installed in vehicles, thereby enabling information on the patient's condition and first aid needs to be transmitted in real time. To secure the patient's biometric data during information transmission, the proposed model weights that information to enhance the efficiency of the IoT devices. Performance evaluation results revealed that compared to existing algorithms, the communication strength of the proposed model is an average of 5.2{\%} higher, and network efficiency between IoT devices and medical sensors is an average of 7.6{\%} higher. In addition, the overhead on IoT devices was an average of 3.5{\%} lower.",
