abstract="As a kind of medical service around people, community health care is closely related to peoples lives, and thus it has also been placed higher requirements. In the face of growing community medical needs, the construction and development of community medical Internet of things is imminent. Subsequently, massive multi-type of medical data which contain all kinds of user identity data, various types of vital signs data and other sensitive information are generated. Such a large scale of data in the transmission, storage and access process is facing the risk of data leakage. To effectively protect the privacy information of patients, an infrastructure framework for privacy protection of community medical Internet of things is proposed. It includes transmission protection based on multi-path asymmetric encryption fragment transmission mechanism, storage protection using distributed symmetric encryption cloud storage scheme and access control with identity authentication and dynamic access authorization. Through theoretical analysis and simulation experiments, it is proved that the community medical data can be effectively protected.",

In this paper, we expose each object capabilities as a web service and propose a resource-oriented service publishing method for devices in IoT. With the proposed ontology-based resource description model, various objects are abstracted as basic resources with multidimensional attributes. The basic resources are further combined into more complex resources to support practical business functions. All the resources will be published by the representational state transfer interface. To evaluate the proposal, we build a prototype system of smart office, and the results show that the designed system can support various business functions with high feasibility and efficiency.",

abstract="Recently, research on cloud-integrated Internet of Things where an Internet of Things (IoT) is converged with a cloud environment has been actively pursued. An IoT operates through interaction among many composition elements, such as actuators and sensors. At present, IoTs are used in diverse areas (for example, traffic control and safety, energy savings, process control, communications systems, distributed robots, and other important applications). In daily life, IoTs should provide services of high reliability corresponding with various physical elements. In order to guarantee highly reliable IoT services, optimized modeling, simulation, and resource management technologies integrating physical elements and computing elements are required. For such reasons, many systems are being developed where autonomic computing technologies are applied that sense any internal errors or external environmental changes occurring during system operation and where systems adapt or evolve themselves. In an IoT environment composed of large-scale nodes, autonomic computing requires a high processing amount and efficient storage processing of computing in order to process sensing data efficiently. In addition, due to the heterogeneous composition of IoT environments, separate middleware is required to share collected information. Accordingly, this paper proposed an efficient resource management scheme (ERMS) that efficiently manages IoT resources using cloud infrastructure satisfying the high availability, expansion, and high processing amount requirements. ERMS provides a XML-based standard sensing data storage scheme in order to store and process heterogeneous IoT sensing data in the cloud infrastructure. In addition, ERMS provides classification techniques to efficiently store and process distributed IoT data.",

abstract="Managing privacy in the IoT presents a significant challenge. We make the case that information obtained by auditing the flows of data can assist in demonstrating that the systems handling personal data satisfy regulatory and user requirements. Thus, components handling personal data should be audited to demonstrate that their actions comply with all such policies and requirements. A valuable side-effect of this approach is that such an auditing process will highlight areas where technical enforcement has been incompletely or incorrectly specified. There is a clear role for technical assistance in aligning privacy policy enforcement mechanisms with data protection regulations. The first step necessary in producing technology to accomplish this alignment is to gather evidence of data flows. We describe our work producing, representing and querying audit data and discuss outstanding challenges.",

abstract="In the era of Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, Secured information transfer is necessitated between mobile and internet based services in IoT environments. As IoT environment connected to heterogeneous network, they become vulnerable to attacks and hence it is required for secured mechanism for data transfer. Moreover, when secured cryptographic algorithms are employed in mobile phones, battery consumption plays a major role. The IoT environment associated with proposed algorithm can be used to interlink humans and enable the use of a communication channel to bring forth inter machine interaction. The encryption procedures used here makes sure that the major concerns of authentication uniqueness, confidentiality and privacy of the users are maintained. This implies that the users and the service providers can implement the system security measures that have been proposed. Research is still being conducted to improve the architecture and implementation strategies in a real time environment. In order to solve those issues, this paper proposes a novel scalar point-multiplication which gives low energy consumed snippet based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) that provides same level of security and also keeps low energy consumption by speeding up the computation time. The performance evaluation with the key size of 14 and 16 bits reveals that the proposed algorithm can be fast and saves the battery life than the other conventional ECC algorithms.",

abstract="Internet of things (IoT) enables a number of embedded systems to interact for the purpose of various IoT applications such as home security, medical, smart surveillance, and etc. It is expected that the need of multimedia computing for ultra-high quality video delivery has further increased the importance of fast and complexity-awareness video compression algorithm under low-complexity and low-power IoT systems. High efficiency video coding (HEVC) is the state-of-the-art video coding technology that can provide powerful video compression performance under limited bandwidth conditions for transmission or storage. Although HEVC adopted newly advanced video coding tools to achieve a bitrate reduction of 50{\%} with similar video quality compared to the previous method, H.264/AVC, these cause heavy computational encoding complexity resulting from inter prediction process of HEVC encoder. In this paper, we propose a complexity scalable SKIP/MERGE encoding algorithm to design a low complexity inter prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed method is much faster than those of HEVC test model (47.42{\%}) and previous method (13.95{\%}) in terms of total encoding time, on average.",

The paper provides a comprehensive assessment of smart city initiatives in China in recent years. Six key conceptual dimensions of smart city practices are classified: energy, agriculture, transport, buildings, urban services, and urban security operations. Chinese smart city policy and practices explore renewable energy and resources, increase public convenience, and make cities more comfortable and citizen friendly. Critical concerns are explored in such areas as integration (within the urban system, with other cities), governance, innovation, and finance. Finally, a policy vision is outlined to build up public-private collaborative networks, to encourage more innovations and investments in smart city initiatives, and to put more emphasis on smart services.",
