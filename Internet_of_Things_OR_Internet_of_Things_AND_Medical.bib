abstract="As a kind of medical service around people, community health care is closely related to peoples lives, and thus it has also been placed higher requirements. In the face of growing community medical needs, the construction and development of community medical Internet of things is imminent. Subsequently, massive multi-type of medical data which contain all kinds of user identity data, various types of vital signs data and other sensitive information are generated. Such a large scale of data in the transmission, storage and access process is facing the risk of data leakage. To effectively protect the privacy information of patients, an infrastructure framework for privacy protection of community medical Internet of things is proposed. It includes transmission protection based on multi-path asymmetric encryption fragment transmission mechanism, storage protection using distributed symmetric encryption cloud storage scheme and access control with identity authentication and dynamic access authorization. Through theoretical analysis and simulation experiments, it is proved that the community medical data can be effectively protected.",

In this paper, we expose each object capabilities as a web service and propose a resource-oriented service publishing method for devices in IoT. With the proposed ontology-based resource description model, various objects are abstracted as basic resources with multidimensional attributes. The basic resources are further combined into more complex resources to support practical business functions. All the resources will be published by the representational state transfer interface.

abstract="Recently, research on cloud-integrated Internet of Things where an Internet of Things (IoT) is converged with a cloud environment has been actively pursued. An IoT operates through interaction among many composition elements, such as actuators and sensors. At present, IoTs are used in diverse areas (for example, traffic control and safety, energy savings, process control, communications systems, distributed robots, and other important applications). In daily life, IoTs should provide services of high reliability corresponding with various physical elements. In order to guarantee highly reliable IoT services, optimized modeling, simulation, and resource management technologies integrating physical elements and computing elements are required. For such reasons, many systems are being developed where autonomic computing technologies are applied that sense any internal errors or external environmental changes occurring during system operation and where systems adapt or evolve themselves. In an IoT environment composed of large-scale nodes, autonomic computing requires a high processing amount and efficient storage processing of computing in order to process sensing data efficiently. In addition, due to the heterogeneous composition of IoT environments, separate middleware is required to share collected information. Accordingly, this paper proposed an efficient resource management scheme (ERMS) that efficiently manages IoT resources using cloud infrastructure satisfying the high availability, expansion, and high processing amount requirements. ERMS provides a XML-based standard sensing data storage scheme in order to store and process heterogeneous IoT sensing data in the cloud infrastructure. In addition, ERMS provides classification techniques to efficiently store and process distributed IoT data.",

abstract="Managing privacy in the IoT presents a significant challenge. We make the case that information obtained by auditing the flows of data can assist in demonstrating that the systems handling personal data satisfy regulatory and user requirements. Thus, components handling personal data should be audited to demonstrate that their actions comply with all such policies and requirements. A valuable side-effect of this approach is that such an auditing process will highlight areas where technical enforcement has been incompletely or incorrectly specified. There is a clear role for technical assistance in aligning privacy policy enforcement mechanisms with data protection regulations. The first step necessary in producing technology to accomplish this alignment is to gather evidence of data flows. We describe our work producing, representing and querying audit data and discuss outstanding challenges.",

abstract="In the era of Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure, Secured information transfer is necessitated between mobile and internet based services in IoT environments. As IoT environment connected to heterogeneous network, they become vulnerable to attacks and hence it is required for secured mechanism for data transfer. Moreover, when secured cryptographic algorithms are employed in mobile phones, battery consumption plays a major role. The IoT environment associated with proposed algorithm can be used to interlink humans and enable the use of a communication channel to bring forth inter machine interaction. The encryption procedures used here makes sure that the major concerns of authentication uniqueness, confidentiality and privacy of the users are maintained. This implies that the users and the service providers can implement the system security measures that have been proposed. Research is still being conducted to improve the architecture and implementation strategies in a real time environment. In order to solve those issues, this paper proposes a novel scalar point-multiplication which gives low energy consumed snippet based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) that provides same level of security and also keeps low energy consumption by speeding up the computation time. The performance evaluation with the key size of 14 and 16 bits reveals that the proposed algorithm can be fast and saves the battery life than the other conventional ECC algorithms.",

High efficiency video coding (HEVC) is the state-of-the-art video coding technology that can provide powerful video compression performance under limited bandwidth conditions for transmission or storage. Although HEVC adopted newly advanced video coding tools to achieve a bitrate reduction of 50{\%} with similar video quality compared to the previous method, H.264/AVC, these cause heavy computational encoding complexity resulting from inter prediction process of HEVC encoder. In this paper, we propose a complexity scalable SKIP/MERGE encoding algorithm to design a low complexity inter prediction. Experimental results show that the proposed method is much faster than those of HEVC test model (47.42{\%}) and previous method (13.95{\%}) in terms of total encoding time, on average.",

abstract="IoT connects devices, humans, places, and even abstract items like events. Driven by smart sensors, powerful embedded microelectronics, high-speed connectivity and the standards of the internet, IoT is on the brink of disrupting today's value chains. Big Data, characterized by high volume, high velocity and a high variety of formats, is a result of and also a driving force for IoT. The datafication of business presents completely new opportunities and risks. To hedge the technical risks posed by the interaction between ``everything'', IoT requires comprehensive modelling tools. Furthermore, new IT platforms and architectures are necessary to process and store the unprecedented flow of structured and unstructured, repetitive and non-repetitive data in real-time. In the end, only powerful analytic tools are able to extract ``sense'' from the exponentially growing amount of data and, as a consequence, data science becomes a strategic asset. The era of IoT relies heavily on standards for technologies which guarantee the interoperability of everything. This paper outlines some fundamental standardization activities. Big Data approaches for real-time processing are outlined and tools for analytics are addressed. As consequence, IoT is a (fast) evolutionary process whose success in penetrating all dimensions of life heavily depends on close cooperation between standardization organizations, open source communities and IT experts.",

abstract="Pavement image segmentation needs to deal with noise spots and has real time requirement. The original FCM method only considers the pixel's gray value and doesn't fully utilize the spatial information of the image. A new fast FCM algorithm is proposed, and it has noise immunity. By comparing with other FCM algorithms, it achieves better segmentation results through less iteration times and more rapid runtime. It is an effective and noise-resistant algorithm for pavement image segmentation from video multimedia in IOT (internet of things) platform.",

Traditional multi-sensor data fusion can deal with the same type of data effectively. However, as new characteristics emerge in the IoT, interoperable service-oriented technologies are required to share real-world data among heterogeneous devices to integrate and fuse the multi-source heterogeneous IoT data. To address these issues, an architecture that can provide guidance for the development of IoT information fusion is required. We compare features of IoT data and information with an existing wireless sensor network and the Internet, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first comparison of this kind. Then, we design a framework for multi-source heterogeneous information fusion in the IoT and use an experimental simulation platform to build an environmental monitoring system to assess the framework.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) enables producers of context data like sensors to interact with remote consumers of context data like smart pervasive applications in an entirely decoupled way. However, two important issues are faced by context data distribution, namely providing context information with a sufficient level of quality---i.e. quality of context (QoC)---while preserving the privacy of context owners. This article presents the solutions provided by the INCOME middleware framework for addressing these two potentially contradictory issues while hiding the complexity of context data distribution in heterogeneous and large-scale environments. Context producers and consumers not only express their needs in context contracts but also the guarantees they are ready to fulfil. These contracts are then translated into advertisement and subscription filters to determine how to distribute context data. Our experiments on a first open source prototype show that QoC-based filtering and privacy protection using attributed-based access control can be performed at a reasonable cost.",

In our model, information of entity status is issued in real-time by the extended structure and is released to the requesters as dynamic services. In this way, the transactions on IoT can be constructed and executed intelligently as needed.

A landslide occurred in the filling body of the eastern part of the Panzhihua airport on October 3, 2009 (hereafter called the 10.3 landslide). We conducted field survey on the landslide and adopted emergency monitoring and warning models based on the Internet of Things (IoT) to estimate the losses from the disaster and to prevent a secondary disaster from occurring. The results showed that four major features of the airport site had contributed to the landslide, i.e, high altitude, huge amount of filling rocks, deep backfilling and great difficulty of backfilling. The deformation process of the landslide had six stages and the unstable geological structure of high fillings and an earthquake were the main causes of the landslide. We adopted relative displacement sensing technology and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) technology to achieve remote, real-time and unattended monitoring of ground cracks in the landslide. The monitoring system, including five extensometers with measuring ranges of 200, 450 and 700 mm, was continuously working for 17 months and released 7 warning signals with an average warning time of about 26 hours. At 10 am on 6 December 2009, the system issued a warning and on-site workers were evacuated and equipment protected immediately.

Frailty of old age, susceptibility to diseases, and impairments are inevitable issues that these senior adults need to deal with in daily life. Recently, there has been an increasing demand on developing elderly care services utilizing novel technologies, with the aim of providing independent living. Internet of things (IoT), as an advanced paradigm to connect physical and virtual things for enhanced services, has been introduced that can provide significant improvements in remote elderly monitoring. Several efforts have been recently devoted to address elderly care requirements utilizing IoT-based systems. Nevertheless, there still exists a lack of user-centered study from an all-inclusive perspective for investigating the daily needs of senior adults. In this paper, we study the IoT-enabled systems tackling elderly monitoring to categorize the existing approaches from a new perspective and to introduce a hierarchical model for elderly-centered monitoring. We investigate the existing approaches by considering the elderly requirements at the center of the attention.

The major problems facing by blind people fall in the category of navigating through indoor and outdoor environments consisting of various obstacles and recognition of person in front of them. Identification of objects or person only with perceptive and audio information is difficult. An intelligent, portable, less expensive, self-contained navigation and face recognition system is highly demanded for blind people. This helps blind people to navigate with the help of a Smartphone, global positioning system (GPS) and a system equipped with ultrasonic sensors. Face recognition can be done using neural learning techniques with feature extraction and training modules. The images of friends, relatives are stored in the database of user Smartphone. Whenever a person comes in front of the blind user, the application with the help of neural network gives the voice aid to the user. Thus this system can replace the regular imprecise use of guide dogs as well as white sticks to help the navigation and face recognition process for people with impaired vision.In this paper, we have proposed a novel image recognition and navigation system which provides precise and quick messages in the form of audio to visually challenged people so that they can navigate easily.

These technologies are key technology of various ICT convergence services, and it will create a value-added business and market. Although it is in its infancy, there is no doubt that it will be a game changer. However, cloud computing technology and IoT technology have some limitations especially in openness and standardization because they have been independently evolved. This is why they expose some weak-points, which are difficult to expand to various services, and it also has some problems to interwork other devices or services. In the safe network case, current safe network service has a restriction because it is based on closed networks. In addition, the key technology in the safe networking has an independent scheme or architecture. Due to the fact that we need new architecture to integrate entire networks, there are no certain alternatives so far. It is because most of related works are focused on the providing to just the safety in the networks. To solve these problems, we propose a safe data transmission architecture for the IoT ecosystems. The proposed architecture is a kind of software defined network base cloud, and it can provide the safe data transmission with QoS/QoE. Basically, the proposed architecture has three states, install, start and working, and four phase, negotiation, initialization, configuration and execution. In the install state, the devices set some parameters such as a synchronization time between node in cloud and IoT device. Based on the install state, data transmission will be started in the start state. In the start state, the nodes start data transmission by the set parameters in the install state. And then, the nodes keep the working state. However, it can be changed whenever user's request to upgrade the transmission security. The proposed architecture has some enhanced synchronization algorithms to provide a safe data transmission and to guarantee a QoS/QoE. Based on the architecture, we verified that the proposed architecture outperforms than legacy architectures in various aspects, and we are shown these simulation results by using OPNET.",
