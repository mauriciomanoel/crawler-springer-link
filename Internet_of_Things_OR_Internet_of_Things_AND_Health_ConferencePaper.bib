The MAC header of DHCP message sent by IoT device is modified newly by adding specific information to reflect the type of IoT device. The DHCP server can recognize the type of IoT device from the newly defined MAC header and return an address to the IoT device with a lease time determined by the type of IoT device. For the efficient management, a policy for allocating address and lease time should be required. According to this policy, allocated addresses and lease times are stored in a lease database. Examples of the table for diverse IoT types and the policy for allocating address and lease time are given.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) plays a significant role in a broad range of healthcare applications. However, so far this effort is mainly restricted to actual patients actively undergoing treatment. From the perspective of IoT, these kinds of efforts should spread to the preventive activity of healthy people in the not-so-distant future. Healthy people, whose population is much larger than patients, presumably have various latent needs or wants for an IoT-driven healthcare system, compared with the actual patients. Discerning the real needs from the latent needs of healthy people for preventive care is the key to build up an innovative and favorable IoT-based system. This research tackled this problem from the product device side. We utilized multiple analyses including cluster analysis, graphical modeling, and text-mining, in order to extract from survey data real and useful consumer needs, which can be expected to propel the innovation of health-related home electronics. The effectiveness of the proposed method was verified by a case study using practical questionnaire data, while selecting a blood-pressure monitor and a sleep monitor as case study examples.",

abstract="Internet of Things or IoT is one of the common and widely used technology used for the formation of smart environments based on sensor-based scenarios. At the current implementation, IoT is being implemented for assorted scenarios including environmental monitoring, production, manufacturing, healthcare, home automations, transportations, and many others. The key idea behind IoT is the machine to machine communication in which each and every device is connected using sensor technology. This paradigm is used for the development and deployment of smart cities and sensor-based infrastructures. Nowadays, IoT is being implemented in many of the transportation services and integrated in cars as well as freight vehicles which make it IoV (Internet of Vehicles). Using this approach, the remote IoT control servers can monitor any of the moving vehicles in real time and tracking can be done on multiple parameters. In the classical implementation, the remote monitoring and tracking is one using towers or base stations and satellites which is not very effective because of assorted quality of service factors. For the enhanced scenario integration, the global positioning system is used but number of security vulnerabilities can be there and cracking can be done. This paper underlines and highlights the scope of IoT in assorted applications with the association to different case scenarios.",

abstract="The currently unfolding Internet of Things (IoT) technologies will enable health services that have higher quality and lower cost than those available today. However, the large majority of the current IoT research and development expects that the IoT ``things'' communicate wirelessly, leaving the question of their energy supply and communication reliability more-or-less open. The obvious alternative, wire line, has gained much less attention, perhaps since it is too well known. In this paper, we present an energy-efficient IoT architecture for healthcare applications that leverages clinical and home care scenarios, given their typically fixed, stationary nature, as the mobility of patients is in many cases confined to a room or a building. The architecture is based on intelligent, wired gateways that are power-efficient and low-cost. The gateways link wired/wireless medical sensors and hospital appliances to web services, enabling hospital automation and widespread data collection and aggregation of vital signs in a convenient, and cost-effective approach.",

The use of RFID and IPv6 allows for a low cost, low maintenance solution. The above combination also helps to develop a transparent information infrastructure that serves the health professional and the patient alike. Apart from the obvious advantages of IPv6 such as larger address space (128 bits long), better header format, provision for extension, resource allocation support (Flow Label) and security features and the RFID's no line of sight requirement, long read range, real-time tracking, multiple tag read/write and database portability, the combination of the two and our proposed Virtual MAC Address Generator can provide a unique tracking, low-cost, low power tool in a multi-sensor hospital environment.",

Wearable sensors recognize anomalous and unforeseen conditions by examining physiological parameters along with the symptoms and transfers the vital signs for medical evaluation. Hence, prompt provisional medication can be done immediately to avoid severe conditions. In the proposed system, a microcontroller is used as a gateway to communicate to the several sensors depending on parameters to be monitored such as pulse rate counter, temperature sensor, accelerometer, etc. The microcontroller acquires the sensor data, processes it, and transmits to the network through appropriate data transmission protocol, successively providing a real-time monitoring of the healthcare parameters for healthcare professionals.

However, due to the limited resources available and privacy concerns, security issues constitute a major obstacle to their deployment. Among these issues, key distribution for heterogeneous nodes is problematic due to the inconsistencies in their cryptographic primitives. This paper introduces a new key management scheme that aims to establish session keys for highly resource-constrained nodes ensuring security protection through strong encryption and authentication means. Our protocol is based on collaboration by offloading heavy asymmetric cryptographic operations to a set of third parties. The generated shared secret is then used to derive further credentials. Security analysis demonstrates that our protocol provides strong security features while the scarcity of resources is taken into consideration.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) evolves very rapidly over time, since everything such as sensors/actuators linked together from around the world with use of evolution of ubiquitous computing through the Internet. These devices have a unique IP address in order to communicate with each other and transmit data with features of wireless technologies. Fog computing or so called edge computing brings all Cloud features to embedded devices at edge network and adds more features to servers like pre-store data of Cloud, fast response, and generate overhasty users reporting. Fog mediates between Cloud and IoT devices and thus enables new types of computing and services. The future applications take the advantage of combing the two concepts Fog and Cloud in order to provide low delay Fog-based and high capacity of storage Cloud-based. This paper proposes an IoT architecture for healthcare network based on Fog to Cloud and Data in Motion (F2CDM). The proposed architecture is designed and implemented over three sites: Site 1 contains the embedded devices layer, Site 2 consists of the Fog network layer, while Site 3 consists of the Cloud network. The Fog layer is represented by a middleware server in Al-Nahrain University with temporary storage such that the data lives inside for 30Â min. During this time, the selection of up-normality in behavior is send to the Cloud while the rest of the data is wiped out. On the other hand, the Cloud stores all the incoming data from Fog permanently. The F2CDM works using Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) for fast response. The results show that all data can be monitored from the Fog in real time while the critical data can be monitored from Cloud. In addition, the response time is evaluated using traffic generator called Tsung. It has been found that the proposed architecture reduces traffic on Cloud network and provides better data analysis.",

abstract="Water source is necessary and an important factor in agricultural and farm production and is a key of our quality of life as well. Monitoring water level of a water source, such as water tank or borewell etc., plays a key role in agricultural. For example if a water level drops below the threshold level for pumping in a borewell, the pump motor may get damaged due to dry running. In such case monitoring water level and controlling the water pump accordingly becomes necessary task. There are many other situations where water level monitoring is an important task. It may be used to preserve water or to study the water usage of a water source. This paper proposes a prototype system design, implementation and description of required tools and technologies to develop Internet of Things (IoT) based water level monitoring system which can be implemented in future smart villages in India.",

The main objective of IoT is to make the world easier for human beings where things around us predict our preferences and context, and act autonomously without human interactions.

Good context based-adaptive approach requires dynamic adaptation to the user, not only to its position, time of day, or to environment characteristics but also to its mood, preferences, or even disabilities.

abstract="Internet of Things is mainly about connected devices embedded in our everyday environment. Typically, `interaction' in the context of IoT means interfaces which allow people to either monitor or configure IoT devices. Some examples include mobile applications and embedded touchscreens for control of various functions (e.g., heating, lights, and energy efficiency) in environments such as homes and offices. In some cases, humans are an explicit part of the scenario, such as in those cases where people are monitored (e.g., children and elderly) by IoT devices. Interaction in such applications is still quite straightforward, mainly consisting of traditional graphical interfaces, which often leads to clumsy co-existence of human and IoT devices. Thus, there is a need to investigate what kinds of interaction techniques could provide IoT to be more human oriented, what is the role of automation and interaction, and how human originated data can be used in IoT.",

The mobile middleware is built on top of the WoX (Web of Topics) platform and quickly permits the deployment of innovation services thanks to its abstraction and user centric model. A validation test bed involving 31 elderly people living in Lecce (Italy) has been carried out for the monitoring of their activities, mainly those connected to positioning and motility both in indoor and outdoor scenarios. Our approach has demonstrated a practical way to replace obtrusive monitoring technique (typical of caregivers) with unobtrusive ones, in order to obtain proactive intervention strategies for a smart city.",

Physical data is rapidly changing which makes it important to keep networking connections active. Any drop in communication can lead to the loss of sensitive data. A redundant network connection is an attempt to utilize common networking solutions in order to decrease the likelihood of network downtime. It does this by adding a new level of abstraction to networking, allowing data to be sent over multiple networking solutions as if it were a single network, as well as an intelligent decision engine to determine the most optimized and reliable connection to use dynamically.",

The patient's physiological data are highly sensitive and important. Any malicious modification in physiological data will make wrong diagnoses and harm the patient health. Therefore, privacy, data security, and user authentication are extremely important for accessing patient's real-time data over an insecure channel. In this regard, we design a secure and robust three-factor remote user authentication and key agreement scheme for remote patient monitoring. We simulate our protocol using AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications) tool, which asserts that the protocol is secure from the replay and man-in-the-middle attacks. The informal security verification proves that the suggested protocol is secure from various security threats. Performance comparison shows that the proposed scheme is efficient in terms of computation cost and communication cost.",

Although this interconnectivity seems simple, in practice management of the IoT hardware and the enormous amounts of data it generates is challenging. To bring the connected future into reality and build advanced and useful services, better resource usage estimation (memory, bandwidth, storage etc.) and resource management is required. We propose a IoT optimization methodology, where resources are estimated at each level of the IoT architecture (i.e. nodes, edges and cloud). Using these estimates, the executed code is redistributed across the network in order to optimize the cost and efficiency of the IoT environment, while taking into a specific context (e.g. environment). Initially, we aim to apply this methodology for statically defined contexts. In our future research we aim to perform the optimization at runtime, redistributing tasks across the IoT network dynamically as the context of the nodes changes.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is projected to significantly impact consumer finance, through greater customer personalisation, more frictionless payments, and novel pricing schemes. The lack of deployed applications, however, renders it difficult to evaluate potential security risks, which is further complicated by the presence of novel, IoT-specific risks absent in conventional systems. In this work, we present two-part study that uses scenario planning to evaluate emerging risks of IoT in a variety of financial products and services, using ISO/IEC 20005:2008 to assess those risks from related work. Over 1,400 risks were evaluated from a risk assessment with 7 security professionals within the financial industry, which was contrasted with an external survey of 40 professionals within academia and industry. From this, we draw a range of insights to advise future IoT research and decision-making regarding potentially under-appreciated risks. To our knowledge, we provide the first empirical investigation for which threats, vulnerabilities, asset classes and, ultimately, risks may take precedence in this domain.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) has been given scant attention in e-government literature, whereas promises are high. The IoT describes a situation whereby physical objects are connected to the Internet and are able to communicate with, and identify themselves to, other devices. These devices generate a huge amount of data. When it is possible to combine data from devices and other systems, new insights may be created which may provide important benefits. In this paper we explore the expected benefits of IoT for e-governance by investigating case studies at the Directorate General of Public Works and Water Management of the Netherlands. The results show that IoT has a variety of expected political, strategic, tactical and operational benefits which implies that IoT enables effective knowledge management, sharing and collaboration between domains and divisions at all levels of the organisation, as well as between government and citizens.",

abstract="Recently, Polyhouse farming has taken the place of traditional farming. This technique reduces dependency on rainfall and dramatically changing environmental conditions and makes the optimum use of land and water resources in a controlled environment. Manually controlled system requires a lot of attention and care. To overcome this limitation, novel technologies like Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor network (SN) can be used. Case studies show that use of electromagnetic or radio spectrum for communication degrades the growth and quality of crops. The visible light communication (VLC) provides an effective solution to this problem using visible light spectrum for communication. VLC outperforms when compared with traditional communication techniques in terms of available frequency spectrum, reliability, security, and energy efficiency. LED source used in VLC acts as communication element as well as is used for illumination. This paper proposes use of sensor network to sense the data like temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and luminosity along with VLC as a medium of communication from node to the network gateway. IoT performs its part in automating polyhouse countermeasures and fertilizer suggestion based on the data processed in cloud for Business Intelligence and Analytics. Thus, the proposed system will ensure automated and sustainable polyhouse farming using VLC and IoT.",

abstract="The Internet-of-Things (IoT) is today a reality, and Smart Systems have taken advantage of this to improve its own sense, act and control capabilities. IoT is a highly heterogeneous environment composed by a vast number of ``things'' (sensors, smart objects, etc.). These ``things'' are based on hardware platforms which can differ widely since manufactures are being capable of develop new devices every day to tackle different application domains. Consequently, a problem emerges regarding which will be the suitable, proper hardware solution for an IoT deployment. Make a right decision is probably one of the toughest challenges for science and technology managers. This work proposes a novel methodology to analyze a set of hardware alternatives based on user's multi-criteria requirements, and advice on the more suitable hardware solution for a specific situation. For proof-of-concept it is used different Arduino boards as hardware alternatives, in which user requirements are based on hardware features. This methodology foresees its use during the development of Smart Systems (e.g.: Transportation, Healthcare) to optimize the selection of hardware platforms.",

Thus, identification technologies and Internet-enabled wireless sensor nodes will be incorporated in homes, cities, vehicles, watches, etc. making them uniquely identified and able to process and communicate information via Internet. Hence, the emergence of the Internet of Things paradigm will bring a lot of smartness to our daily life and will improve the way people monitor their goods, expenses, environment and health status. The smart connected things in the IoT interact with each other and/or with the regular Internet hosts according to two communications styles: Thing-to-Thing(s) (T2T) and Human-to-Thing (H2T). Enabling security for such communications is a real issue especially in H2T interactions. This is mainly due to scarce resources of the connected objects and the asymmetric nature of the communications between those smart things and the ordinary Internet hosts. In this paper we address this problematic and we propose an asymmetric security model that mitigates H2T communication heterogeneities and provides reasonable security costs.",

A very important aspect in IoT applications is the communication protocols used by sensors for sending and exchange information. Traditional protocols used so far do not have the scope and ability to manage a growing up computational elements used in modern IoT applications. New communications schemes based on spread spectrum and Long Range (LoRa) coverage, offer new horizons for design and implement low power and long-range sensor networks. In this paper, we describe a new, robust and lightweight communication protocol implemented over the physical layer of LoRa, providing effectiveness and low power consumption suitable for IoT applications. A coverage analysis in both urban and rural environments confirms the success in the selection of this technology and opens new challenges for developing useful applications in several domains as for example smart cities, smart-health, smart factory, remote monitoring, precision agriculture, energy management and remote monitoring and control.",

Applying an iterative design science research approach, the present paper describes (a) the methodology, (b) the requirements, (c) the design and (d) the evaluation of a business model framework that enables researchers and practitioners to visualize, analyze and design business models in the IoT context in a structured and actionable way. The identified dimensions in the framework include the value network of collaborating partners (who); sources of value creation (where); benefits from collaboration (why).

abstract="Technology now offers the possibility of delivering a vast range of low-cost people-centric services to citizens. Internet of Things (IoT) supporting technologies are becoming robust, viable and cheaper. Mobile phones are increasingly more powerful and disseminated. On the other hand, social networks and virtual worlds are experiencing an exploding popularity and have millions of users. These low-cost technologies can now be used to create an Internet of People (IoP), a dynamically configurable integration platform of connected smart objects that allows enhanced, people-centric applications. As opposed to things-centric ones, IoP combines the real, sensory world with the virtual world for the benefit of people while it also enables the development of sensing applications in contexts such as e-health, sustainable mobility, social networks enhancement or fulfilling people's special needs. This paper identifies the main challenges, a possible approach, and key enabling technologies for a people-centric society based on the Internet of Things.",

abstract="With the widespread of Internet of Things' devices, sensors, and applications the quantity of collected data grows enormously and the need of extracting, merging, analyzing, visualizing, and sharing it paves the way for new research challenges. This ongoing revolution of how personal devices are used and how they are becoming more and more wearable has important influences on the most well established definitions of end user and end-user development. The paper presents an analysis of the most diffused applications that allow end users to aggregate quantified-self data, originated by several sensors and devices, and to use it in personalized ways. From the outcomes of the analysis, we present a classification model for Internet of Things and new EUD paradigm and language that extends the ones existing in the current state of the art Internet of Things.",

In this work, we focus on the delivery of an AAL framework utilizing IoT technologies, while addressing the demand for very customized automations due to the diverse and fluid (can change over time) user requirements. The latter turns the idea of a general-purpose application suite to fit all users mostly unrealistic and suboptimal. Driven by the popularity of visual programming tools, especially for children, we focused in directly enabling end-users, including carers, family or friends, even the elderly/disabled themselves, to easily craft and modify custom automations.

abstract="The paper concerns information and control systems that are employed by mining industries. These systems function in specific and often extreme conditions. As such, the design and manufacture of these systems is not only the matter of information technologies but a lot of concurrent problems must be solved like ensuring deliveries of fire and blast resistant components, inspection and auditing provisions, certification, authority licensing, etc. Nevertheless, the technologies are being constantly developed, implying new possibilities for system applications. One of the new information system trends, on which our Institute has also focused its attention, is represented by the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT key idea is an on-line Internet cross connection of information systems, computers, technical equipment, etc., in an unified system. An important constituent of the concept is also the unequivocal identification of individual objects (especially the ever moving forward technology of the RFID). The design of systems of such level of integration inevitably needs an integrated databases provision and solving the problems of converting data that have been collected at various places and yielded by different equipment sensors. The IoT concept provides for substantially wider integration possibilities concerning key information needed for control, as well as availability of such information for further application. An important part of the overall system design is the presentation layer, which asks for processing of clearly presented, synoptically easy to take information flows. As such, providing for a sophisticated visualization of information is a prerequisite for the system functional success.",

We took readings in each of these environments such as an indoor Basketball Court, an Auditorium, and a room (our lab) and to verify results in outdoor conditions we chose parking lot as one of the testing environments. Further analysis and experimentation were performed to get detailed results. Results were obtained using widely used Zolertia Z1 hardware motes arranged in a specific and consistent pattern.

abstract="Internet of Things (IOT) services provide new security and privacy challenges in our everyday life. But no empirical instrument has been developed for the class of IOT services that identifies privacy factors that predict usage intentions and individuals' willingness to provide personal information. The contribution of this paper is to address this lack of research. The proposed research model integrates the Extended Privacy Calculus Model and the Technology Acceptance Model and is pre-tested with 30 IOT experts. Results indicate that intentions to use IOT services are influenced by various factors such as perceived privacy risks and personal interest. It is further assumed that factors such as legislation, data security or transparency of information use influence the adoption of IOT services. Accordingly, further research must focus on a better understanding of these factors to increase the adoption of both useful and secure IOT services.",

The objectives for this research include: (1) summarizing the current business models for IoT, (2) analyzing the impact of IoT on software business models (3) analyzing the impact of IoT on requirements engineering. We conducted a systematic snowballing literature review, followed by an industrial survey. We identified 21 peer reviewed papers which were analyzed in relation to their rigor and relevance and received 56 survey responses. The results of the literature review indicate 9 business model elements that IoT literature focus on. Morevoer, 4 business model aspects were described with respect to the business model structure, context and governance. The industrial survey results highlighted that value proposition, followed by customer segmentation and revenue streams were the most important business model elements for IoT. Moreover, the survey results suggest that requirement management, requirement prioritization and requirement modeling and analysis are highly impacted by IoT.",

Within the IoT, physical objects, ``things'', are networked and connected to the Internet. These ``things'' are able to identify themselves to and communicate with other devices or ``things''. There are many impediments blocking the adoption of IoT, and there is limited insight in these barriers. In this paper, impediments for the adoption of IoT are investigated by conducting a literature review and carrying out two case studies. The impediments found in literature were confirmed and extended using the case studies. Results show that impediments are interrelated and occur on the strategic, tactical and operational level. For adoption the impediments needs to be addressed in concert. Research on e-governance can benefit from understanding these interrelated impediments.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) envisions as a global network, connecting any objects around us, ranging from home appliances, wearable things to military applications. With IoT infrastructure, physical objects such as wearable objects, television, refrigerator, smart phones, supply-chain items and any objects across the globe would get connected using the Internet. Sensing, radio waves, mobile technology, embedded systems and Internet technology are promising actors which play significant roles in IoT infrastructure. Security and privacy issues in IoT scenarios would be much more challenging than what is been used in the conventional wireless scenarios. In particular, the constrained environments require lightweight primitives, secure design and effective integration into other environments in order to see IoT in its desired shape. In this paper, we discuss security and privacy challenges in IoT scenarios and applications with special emphasis on resource-constrained environments' security objectives and privacy requirement. We provide different perspectives of IoT, discuss about important driving forces of IoT, and propose a generic construction of secure protocol suitable for constrained environments with respect to IoT scenarios and applications.",

The application of technology for fall prediction and detection can be divided at large into the image data analysis method and sensor data analysis method which focuses on data from sensors detecting physical activities. The applications of sensors include acceleration sensors, air pressure sensors, vibration sensors, gyroscopes, audio sensors, etc. The IoT expected to be further expanded in conjunction with big data analysis and home care service in the period ahead. For that, simplification of easy-to-operate device interfaces, linkage with home care services, more secure information collection and management should be ensured through synchronization with various devices and more rigorous security control of collected information.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) is a heterogeneous and dynamic space as it connects a variety of sensing, mobile and other physical objects. Traditional security controls and mechanisms tend to enforce pre-defined and manual risk mitigation approaches that manage security in a particular context. They seem to be insufficient in IoT scenarios that have a diverse and evolving technology outlook and threat spectrum. Adaptive security can be a suitable candidate for IoT security as it can observe and respond to threats dynamically. However, it is challenging to identify how practical are the existing adaptive security solutions in IoT-driven ecosystem. In this paper, we present an evaluation framework that assesses the feasibility of adaptive security models in IoT settings. The framework evaluates a given model from an adaptive risk management perspective and assesses the extent to which it is aware of its ecosystem. Moreover, it captures the essential features of a given model, such as adaptation aptitude and architectural aspects. Therefore, the framework determines the security as well as the architectural capabilities of a model. We have evaluated various models and have identified major trends and gaps in their modeling approaches.",

From those emerging areas, there is a clear trend to augment the physical devices/objects with sensing, computing {\&} communication capabilities, connect them together to form a network and make use of the collective effect of networked smart things â the Internet of Things(IoT). This paper proposes the IoT architecture ``Kaivalyam'' for sensors/actuator. The configurable interface generates the identity of the `Thing' and stores in 32-bit datagram. The various configuration of the 32-bit datagram from 4,8,12 and 16-bit device data and respective 14, 12, 10 and 8-bits duplicate identifier can scale the number of devices connected to design platform. These datagram's read into FIFO of the Triple Speed Ethernet (TSE) for transmission using Low Density Parity Check (LDPC) encoder. Simulation studies for the system were performed for block length 512 bits, which is the minimum Ethernet frame length of 64 bytes. AWGN(Additive White Gaussian Noise) is introduced in the channel and BER(Bit Error Rate) is computed for different (1dB to 6dB) SNR(Signal to Noise Ratio) showing BER of 10-4 -4 to 10-5 can be achieved for SNR of 2.5 dB indicating the secured and reliable data transmission.",

These objects coordinate with each other to share the information gathered from phenomena of interest. IoT is a broad term and has attain popularity with the integration of Cloud Computing and Big Data. The partnership among these technologies is revolutionizing the world in which we live and interact with different devices. On the down side, there are lot of speculations and forecasts about the scale of IoT products expected to be available in the market. Most of the products are vendor-specific and as such are not interoperable. They lack a unified standard and are not compatible with each other. Another major issue with these products is the lack of secured features. Albeit, IoT devices are resource-rich, however, they are not capable to communicate in absence of embedded sensor nodes. The presence of resource-constrained sensors in the core of each IoT device make it resource-starving and as such require extremely lightweight but secured algorithms to combat various attacks and malevolent entities from spreading their malicious data. In this paper we aim to propose an extremely lightweight mutual handshaking algorithm for authentication. The proposed scheme verifies the identity of each participating device because establishing communication. Our scheme is based on client-server interaction model using Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP). A 4-byte header, extremely lightweight parsing complexity and JSON based payload encryption make it a lightweight scheme for IoT objects. The proposed scheme can be used as an alternative to DTLS schemes, the one common nowadays for IoT objects.",

abstract="Over the past few years, it has become obvious that Internet of Things, in which all embedded devices are interconnected, will soon turn into reality. These smart devices have limited processing and energy resources and there is a need to provide security guarantees for applications running on them. In order to meet these demands, in this paper we present a POSIX-compliant native runtime environment which runs over a L4-based microkernel, a thin operating system, on top of which applications for embedded devices can run and thus be a part of the Internet of Things.",

abstract="Contactless devices and smart cards have been widely in use in daily life transactions for a long time. At first, those systems were designed to work fully offline for both the reader and the card side. With technological improvements, Internet connection can be available even in very small embedded devices (IoT devices). As a result, current systems have connected devices as a part of the transaction design and so keeping the system operational all the time relies on the availability of continuous Internet connectivity of such devices. After the invention of NFC technology, contactless cards in our wallets are being replaced with virtual cards in mobile handsets. Regular contactless cards never had the capability to connect the Internet, whereas almost all of the modern mobile handsets routinely access the Internet. This has resulted in a trend shift in contactless transaction designs. Offline verification operations are being replaced with online operation where the system uses the connection capabilities of the mobile handset. However, the connection capability either in the mobile handset or in the transaction acceptance reader is not completely stable yet to rely on. Therefore, in this paper, we examine such connection loss problems in IoT devices and we offer a connection sharing mechanism through NFC so that the transaction can be completed if either one of these two entities has the Internet connection. Our proposed mechanism covers both reader-card communication and also peer-to-peer communication of NFC.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is the future of Internet where users, machines and everyday Things have the ability to sense, communicate and interact with their environment. IoT promises a wide variety of applications to make the human's life more comfortable, safe and improve quality of life. It's also considered as big business opportunity for enterprises based on huge quantity of data gathered by connected Things. In the IoT applications such as smart home, smart city, heath and so on, Things cohabit with humans and deal with their personal data even the most private ones. When this data is collected massively and exposed to Internet without an explicit person's agreement, Things constitute by this way a threat for privacy, which is a universal human right. Thus privacy preservation is one of the most prominent issues in IoT. This paper analyzes the privacy in the context of IoT based on case study, and proposes mechanisms to improve security and preserve privacy. This analysis considers also the economic advantages related to the use of IoT as new business opportunity without personal private data disclosure. The proposed solutions are based on data anonymity technologies with recommendation for users and for developers of IoT application.",

abstract="The proliferation of distributed digital technologies in contemporary enterprise challenges the understanding of situated action. This paper revisits this notion in the era of Big Data and the Internet of Things. Drawing upon longitudinal studies within the offshore oil and gas industry, we empirically expand upon Knorr Cetina's ``synthetic situation'' to encompass data-intensive work where people are not co-located with the physical objects and phenomena around which work is organized. By highlighting the performative nature of synthetic situations in the Internet of Things -- where phenomena are algorithmically enacted through digital technologies -- we elaborate upon the original formulation of synthetic situations by demonstrating that (i) algorithmic phenomena constitute the phenomena under inquiry, rather than standing in for physical referents; (ii) noise is irreducible in algorithmic phenomena; (iii) synthetic situations are productive rather than reductive. Finally, we draw brief methodological implications by proposing to focus on the material enactment of data in practice.",

Therefore, how to address security problem in RFID system is a crucial issue for the security of the IoT. The RFID authentication protocol is a key cryptographic protocol ensuring communication security because it could provide authentication between the tag and the server. Recently, elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)-based RFID authentication protocols were studied widely because they could provide better security attributes compared with traditional RFID authentications. Lv et al. proposed three ECC-based RFID protocols and claimed their protocols could overcome weaknesses in previous protocols. Unfortunately, in this paper, we show that Lv et al.'s protocols cannot withstand the man-in-the-middle attack. To solve security problems in their protocols, we propose three improved ECC-based RFID authentication protocols.",

abstract="In the past few years, the viability of the Internet of Things (IoT) technology has been demonstrated, leading to increased possibilities for novel human-centric services in the smart cities. This development has resulted in numerous approaches being proposed for harnessing IoT for smart city applications. Having received a significant attention by the research community and industry, IoT adaptation has gained momentum. IoT-enabled applications are being rapidly developed in a number of domains such as energy management, waste management, traffic control, mobility, healthcare, ambient assisted living, etc. On the other hand, this high-speed development and adaptation has resulted in the emergence of heterogeneous IoT architectures, standards, middlewares, and applications. This heterogeneity is hindrance in the realization of a much anticipated IoT global eco-system. Hence, the heterogeneity (from hardware level to application level) is a critical issue that needs high-priority and must be resolved as early as possible. In this article, we present and discuss the modelling of heterogeneous IoT data streams in order to overcome the challenge of heterogeneity. The data model is used within the VITAL project which is an open source IoT system of systems. The main objective of the VITAL platform is to enable rapid development of cross-platform and cross-context IoT based applications for smart cities.",

The main features, architecture, and initial experiments of this approach are introduced. Rather than take all the data produced by Internet of Things, this approach focuses on acquiring only interesting data for its knowledge discovery process. By catching decision events, this approach gathers its own daily operation experience, which is the interesting data, and uses such experience for knowledge discovery. An initial experiment was made at the end of this paper, by applying this approach to a sensors-equipped bicycle, the bicycle is able to learn user's physical features and recognize its user out of other riders. Customized version of Decisional DNA is used in this approach as the knowledge representation technique. Decisional DNA is a domain-independent, and flexible, and standard experiential knowledge repository solution that allows knowledge to be acquired, reused, evolved and shared easily. The presented conceptual approach demonstrates how knowledge can be discovered through its domain's experiences and stored as Decisional DNA.",

abstract="Internet of Things enables every node on a personal network to be managed and monitored remotely over the Internet. Biometric devices, used for access control or as bio-sensors, form a critical part of Internet of Things and are identified using IPv6 address. Malicious users can track activity of these devices by spoofing IPv6 addresses from unsecure wireless communication channels. Tracking device activity and identifying user behavior of the device poses a great threat to device identity and data generated by it. Such a threat can be avoided by keeping the device's IPv6 address hidden from attacker. This study proposes a method to privacy enable IPv6 address configuration for connected devices in general and biometric devices in particular, while connected as a part of Internet of Things. It is proposed that by changing the device's IPv6 address periodically and pseudorandomly, its identity can be kept private to a large extent. These address changes are configured on devices based on congruence classes, which generate non-repeatable integer sequence. It is proposed that the interface identification part of IPv6 address is configured with two-level hierarchy with each level level using a different congruence class. Such configuration generates different identification values to ensure conflict free address configuration. The proposition is analyzed for privacy preserving property and communication cost. The results of performance benchmarking using Cooja simulator show that the method does not impose substantial communication overhead on IPv6 address configuration process.",

In this paper, based on the literature, our experience in these two domains, and case studies with Ubicomp and IoT applications, we discuss how we can benefit from the UbiComp move towards IoT, focusing on the main differences and similarities related to interaction evaluation. These differences open a set of questions that are also presented and discussed in this paper.",

abstract="Internet of Things systems rely on the principles for service deployment and configuration based on delivery models. The predominant service delivery model for the Internet of Things architecture is a novel approach to create a global IoT system for Internet Connected Objects. While the service control loop has already been proposed (autonomics), the dynamic deployment of the different modules of an IoT system is still due. In this paper an approach for IoT service delivery model using autonomic management principles, which can deploy and configure IoT services is presented. The use of an implemented framework that helps administrator/user to deploy IoT platform(s) with autonomic methods has been developed. Particularly and as proof of concept example an open source platform (                    www.superstreamcollider.org                                      ) is used to demonstrate service instantiation. The agent-based framework analyses the requirements, dependencies and resolves them following autonomic design principles and also, by design, it deploys the IoT service delivery model into desired platform(s) running in the cloud or into a local machine.",

abstract="This paper seeks to raise awareness of the potential benefits and detriments resulting from sensor intrusion in the Internet of Things (IoT). The conclusion of this paper is that the IoT has been rendered inevitable as the result of a confluence of historical trends, but that we can make choices regarding its fundamental architecture that can tip the balance of harm and benefit more toward individual or institutional rights and obligations. Once the choices are ``baked in'' they will be more difficult to alter in future IoT iterations. It is hoped that collective attention to the issues raised in this paper will help to guide these decisions so that the IoT systems we build will result in fewer surprises.",

abstract="The singular value decomposition (SVD) is a widely used matrix factorization tool which underlies many useful applications, e.g. recommendation system, abnormal detection and data compression. Under the environment of emerging Internet of Things (IoT), there would be an increasing demand for data analysis. Moreover, due to the large scope of IoT, most of the data analysis work should be handled by fog computing. However, the fog computing devices may not be trustable while the data privacy is the significant concern of the users. Thus, the data privacy should be preserved when performing SVD for data analysis. In this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving fog computing framework for SVD computation. The security and performance analysis shows the practicability of the proposed framework. One application of recommendation system is introduced to show the functionality of the proposed framework.",

Now we can communicate with smart device, such as microwave oven, camera, and control it using App in our smart phone, but due to the poor computing power of smart device, it tends to be intractable to protect this communication from attack. By analyzing the security threats faced during the process of smart device and App authenticating each other's identity, this paper proposed a lightweight transfer protocol for smart device, and introduced ``Authentication Center'' to help with authentication for smart device and App. In consideration of poor computing power of smart device, the lightweight protocol achieves effective reduction of network resource usage. Acting as a hub, the Authentication Center does the heavy certification and authorization work as well as the management of smart device. This protocol can protect data confidentiality, data integrity against replay attack, man-in-the-middle attack by ensuring the identities of device and App with the help of Authentication Center.",

It is new revolution that not only allows transmission and exchange of data but also communication between the physical objects in the real world. These heterogeneous devices are pervasive, ubiquitous in nature that changes dynamically and frequently. Mostly, these devices are low-powered devices and have less computation power and capacity. Traditional routing techniques in ad hoc network do not take security and energy into consideration. To extend the lifetime of the network, the energy supply and consumption of the node is an important aspect. The routing of the packet should be as such that even the low-powered devices have the ability to receive and transmit the packet. The presence of malicious node will make the network more susceptible to the different attacks and threat. To overcome this problem, an energy-efficient routing protocol with a centralized controller is integrated with IOT devices.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) seeks to broaden the scope of the Internet by connecting a variety of devices that can communicate with the Internet. Transport services for IoT are crucial in enabling the applications to communicate reliably and in a timely manner while making efficient and fair use of the potentially scarce network resources. The communication with IoT devices is often implemented using HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or a specifically designed protocol such as Constrained Application Protocol (CoAP) that is a specialized web transfer protocol for constrained nodes and networks. In this paper we discuss various options for modifying or adapting HTTP to offer better transport service for IoT environments. We consider HTTP, SPDY that has been developed to speed up HTTP in general, IoT-HTTP and IoT-SPDY that are adaptations of HTTP and SPDY for IoT, and CoAP as transport services for IoT and experimentally evaluate their performance. The results of our experiments show that CoAP has the lowest object download times and the least number of bytes transferred compared to the other four transport services. IoT-HTTP and IoT-SPDY have around 50{\%} shorter object download times and smaller number of bytes transferred compared to HTTP and SPDY.",

abstract="Things search engines play a key role in increasing the visibility of the emerging Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm. Developing an innovative search approach is a fundamental step to lay the foundations of future IoT search engines. Currently, the most adopted approach for searching things is based on keyword search. Unfortunately, keyword search does not provide enough functionality for an IoT search engine. Correlating things based on their attributes is an emerging approach which can potentially improve the IoT search process. Since in reality there might exist a number of different correlations between a pair of everyday objects, integrating and applying them in IoT search is challenging. In this paper, we propose the ECS (Extract, Cluster, Select) framework. Our framework contains a novel approach to extract and integrate different types of correlation graphs with a spectral clustering method and a selection method to improve the coherence and the diversity of top-k results for a given search query. We evaluate our framework through extensive experiments using real-world datasets from different domains of IoT applications. The results show that the quality of search results improves greatly after we diversify the results of IoT data queries.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is an emergent paradigm characterized by a plethora of smart objects connected to the Internet. An inherent characteristic of IoT is the high heterogeneity and the wide distribution of objects, thereby calling for ways to describe in an unambiguous and machine-interpretable way the resources provided by objects, their properties, and the services they offer. In this context, discovery services play a significant role as they allow clients (middleware platforms, end-users, applications) to retrieve available resources based on appropriate search criteria, such as resource type, capabilities, location, and Quality of Context (QoC) parameters. To cope with these concerns, we introduce QoDisco, a QoC-aware discovery service relying on multiple-attribute searches, range queries, and synchronous/asynchronous operations. QoDisco also comprises an ontology-based information model for semantically describing resources, services, and QoC-related information. In this paper, we describe the QoDisco architecture and information model as well as an evaluation of the search procedure in an urban air pollution monitoring scenario.",

However, the use of IoT technology to implement Industry 4.0 will require a collaborative efforts. There are many aspects that all stake holders both in IT world and Industry 4.0 will need to consider; these multiple aspects can be defined (i) smooth integration of the newly developed IoT sensors (things) into existing industries. (ii) Transparent secure communication channel and software layer to link manufacturing data with cloud based SW platforms. (iii) Developing a standard IoT architecture; Open standard is vital to guarantee hundreds of millions of Internet-connected things are inter-operable and being able to communicate with each other.

On the other hand, such users need an environment in which they can express proper requirements for enabling the system to react autonomously according to events in the real/physical world, by running processes that trigger actions and perform services.

We look at the challenge of data interoperability in the IoT context and describe the Hypercat standard; a specification for representing and exposing Internet of Things data catalogues to improve data discoverability and interoperability. The central idea is to enable distributed data repositories (data hubs) to be used jointly by applications by making it possible to query their catalogues in a uniform machine-readable format. This enables the creation of ``knowledge graphs'' of available datasets across multiple hubs that applications can exploit and query to identify and access the data they need, whatever the data hub in which they are held. This is achieved by employing the same principles on which linked data and the web are built: data accessible through standard web protocols and formats (HTTPS, JSON, and REST); the identification of resources through URIs; and the establishment of common, shared semantics for the descriptors of datasets. We exemplify by way of several demonstrations of IoT applications which use data from Hypercat-enabled data hubs.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) promising a new generation of services been offered to a human being through a world of interconnected objects (called ``things'') that may use different communication technologies. Objects, in IoT, are seamlessly connected on its owner/user behalf. To offer services, the service providers need to truly identify the effective actor/user rather than the communicated devices. Currently, users have relationships with multiple objects that can also be used to determine their user. These relationships between actors are changeable or may even vanish; however, they are important to distinguish the actual requester of the service. Hence, it is important to consider them when identifying the effective actor of the communicated object. This paper models these relationships, representing them in a general form, and proposes a new semantic identifier format that allows service providers to identify the service requester identity across domains based on those relationships.",

New challenges raise in terms of connectivity, resource discovery and support for multidomains distributed applications. Furthermore, the connection parameters of involved devices can dynamically change over the time and must be properly discovered. This paper proposes a multi broker platform (MBP) built on top of an existing interoperability platform, Smart-M3. MBP enables the original platform to manage multi-domain scenarios, it also provides a semantic mechanism for context-broker discovery and a virtualization interface to reach remote nodes.",

abstract="In the emerging field of Internet of Things (IoT), where computerized devices are combined in creative new ways, there is a need to create Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) for the systems being built, e.g. in the form of Android ``apps''. This is generally a complicated, time consuming task. We report from a controlled experiment that evaluates a new approach for building GUIs that aims to make it easier for more people to build quality GUIs. A tool supporting the new approach (GPE) was compared to Android Studio (AS                                                                                  {\$}{\$}{\{}{\}}{\_}{\{}{\}}{\$}{\$}                  ), the industry standard for Android development.

abstract="Today, almost every individual possesses at least one internet-connected device. According to Cisco, there were over 12.5 billion devices in 2010 alone. It has been predicted that 25 billion devices will be connected by 2015, and 50 billion devices by 2020; all contributing towards the Internet of Things (IoT). This rapid increase exposes the obvious need for enhancements in various underlying technologies. IPv6 for example, has been developed to provide 340 undecillion IP addresses, and 3GPP LTE and its further enhancements provides impressive high bitrates cost-efficiently. That been said, there is still a limit on the amount of data that can go through a frequency channel. Therefore, the surge in demand for data by the billions of devices emphasizes the need to re-visit spectrum planning. Beginning with a review on the success of unlicensed spectrum operations, this work looks into the potentials of complementing the licensed frequency bands with unlicensed by tapping into the advantages of millimeter wave access technology.",

First, we present an overview of the IoT and the importance of trust in relation to it, and then we provide an in-depth trust/reliable management protocol for the IoT and evaluate comparable trust management protocols. We also investigate a scalable solution for trust management in the IoT and provide a comparative evaluation of existing trust solutions. We then present a context-aware assessment for the IoT and compare the different trust solutions. Lastly, we give a full comparative analysis of trust/reliability management in the IoT. Our results are drawn from this comparative analysis, and directions for future research are outlined.",

We develop a model that identifies how data is presented to users and how users interact with the system, and the level at which systems interconnect with, and collects data from, external systems. Companies can use the model to map their systems according to the dimensions in order to: (1) identify current state of their systems, (2) identify desired state and (3) better understand the steps necessary to develop more advanced IoT systems.

Yet, such a large scaled environment needs a semantic background to achieve interoperability and knowledge diffusion. Furthermore, this open, distributed and heterogeneous environment raises important challenges, such as trustworthiness among the various types of devices and participants. Developing and sharing ontologies that support trust management models and applications would be an effective step in achieving semantic interoperability on a large scale. Currently, most of the ontologies and semantic description frameworks in the Internet of Things are either context-based or at an early stage. This paper reports on identifying and incorporating social and non-social parameters involved in the Internet of Things in a general-purpose ontology that will support trust management. This ontology will include among others data and semantics about trust principles, involved parties, characteristics of entities, rating parameters, rule-based mechanisms, confidence and dishonesty in the environment. Defining an ontology and using semantic descriptions for data related to trustworthiness issues will provide an important instrument in developing distributed trust (reputation) models.",

However, in line with the recent trends in cloud computing and the emergence of the IoTS, we believe that both DSM creation tools and DSM solutions that are created via those tools should also be provided to their respective users in a service-oriented fashion through the cloud in the IoTS. In this work, we concentrate on the latter, i.e., DSM solutions that are created via a DSM creation tool. We argue that it makes sense for the owners of a DSM solution in a domainÂ to provide their DSM solution as a service, following the well known Software as a Service (SaaS) model, to the interested customers through the IoTS.

abstract="Generating source code from a software spec to automate software development is arguably one of the most challenging tasks due to, for example, the complexity of software domain, richness of user interface and the heterogeneity of development platforms. Domain-specific approaches make code generation technically possible by narrowing down the software domain. Internet of Things is a paradigm shift in computing that might eventually give rise to the proliferation of dedicated software methods and tools. Domain-specific software engineering in this new computing paradigm leaves a lot to be desired. In this paper, we propose an approach to semi-automatically generating C code out of a visual design for the software module controlling wearable devices. The visual design consists of (i) input panel describing components that receive input data and how they are wired to the module; (ii) output panel describing components that produce output data and how they are wired to the module; (iii) connectivity and data storage; and (iv) state machine of the module. We have tested our domain-specific framework in a case-study where wearable devices used for ordering (i.e., to serve restaurant's clients) and delivering (i.e., to assist restaurant's waiters) food at a restaurant need to be developed.",

The paper defines the architecture of the platform, expanding the functionality and correlation between modules that make up the platform, and proposes a software representation of a Thing and also a software representation of a Context as used in the IoT network. Using both software representations, platform modules manage tasks that discover all available devices in a surrounding area and create proper context for devices to collaborate, schedule smart device communication and establish communication between available devices in the network.

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is in a continuous development, the basic notion of IoT is that each object within the global network is accessible and interconnected. In such an environment, Wireless Sensor Networks play a crucial role, since they support different applications domains. Nevertheless, security issues are the major obstacle for their deployment. Among these issues, authentication of the different interconnected entities and exchanged data confidentiality. In this paper, we propose a new ultra-lightweight authentication scheme for heterogeneous wireless sensor networks in the context of IoT. This scheme allows both of the sensor and the user to authenticate each other in order to secure the communication. The proposed scheme uses only nonces, exclusive-or, concatenation operations to achieve mutual authentication. Moreover, it terminates with a session key agreement between the sensor node and the user. To assess our scheme, we carry out a performance and security analysis. The obtained results show that the proposed scheme provides authentication with low energy consumption, and ensures a resistance against different types of attacks.",

abstract="As the number of connected devices is exponentially growing, the IoT community is investigating potential ways of overcoming the resulting heterogeneity to enable device compatibility, interoperability and integration. The Semantic Web technologies, frequently used to address these issues, have been employed to develop a number of ontological frameworks, aiming to provide a common vocabulary of terms for the IoT domain. Defined in Web Ontology Language -- a language based on the Description Logics, and thus equipped with the `off-the-shelf' support for formal reasoning -- these ontologies, however, seem to neglect the built-in automated reasoning capabilities. Accordingly, this paper discusses the possibility of leveraging this idle potential for automated analysis in the context of defining and enforcing policies for the IoT. As a first step towards a proof of concept, the paper focuses on a simple use case and, using the existing IoT-Lite ontology, demonstrates different types of semantic classification to enable policy enforcement. As a result, it becomes possible to detect a critical situation, when a dangerous temperature threshold has been exceeded. With the proposed approach, IoT practitioners are offered an already existing, reliable and optimised policy enforcement mechanism. Moreover, they are also expected to benefit from support for policy governance, separation of concerns, a declarative approach to knowledge engineering, and an extensible architecture.",

In this paper, we examine the security of different categories of IoT devices to understand their resilience under different security conditions for attackers. In particular, we analyse IoT robustness against attacks performed under two threat models, namely (i) physical access of the attacker, (ii) close proximity of the attacker (i.e., RFID and WiFi ranges). We discuss the results of the tests we performed on different categories of IoT devices, namely IP cameras, OFo bike locks, RFID-based smart-locks, and smart-home WiFi routers.

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) possesses a dynamic network where the network nodes (mobile devices) are added and removed constantly and randomly; hence, the traffic distribution in the network is quite variable and irregular. The basic but very important part in any network is route searching. We have many conventional route searching algorithms such as link-state and distance vector algorithms, but they are restricted to the static point-to-point network topology. In this paper, we proposed a hypothetical but feasible model that uses the ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm for route searching. ACO is dynamic in nature and has a positive feedback mechanism that conforms to the route searching. In addition, we have embedded the concept of deterministic finite automata (DFA) minimization to minimize the number of iterations done by ACO in finding the optimal path from source to sink. Analysis and proof show that ACO gives the shortest optimal path from the source to the destination node, and DFA minimization reduces the broadcasting storm effectively.",

abstract="Internet of things (IoT) has now become a fascinating system that improves information technology for its use in homes, cities and medical sectors. IoT works as an extension of internet to realize interconnections among every day object based on platform independent communication protocols. Object forming IoT must possess sensing, communication, and computation capabilities leading to a convenient as well as economical assistance for society. Interaction among heterogeneous objects enhances the security vulnerabilities in IoT. The current four layered communication stack of IoT supports protocols at each layer for enabling connectivity of heterogeneous objects. With security as a prime concern, communication in IoT need to maintained using a secure mechanism to protect the system from attacks. This paper analyzes various existing protocols at each layer with their inherent security mechanisms and exposing their vulnerabilities to different attacks. This paper will unlock new research areas for improving the inbuilt security mechanisms.",

abstract="Nowadays the smart home represents the most sensible form of the Internet of Things (IoT) world. The communication protocols allowing devices to share data and respond to commands using a little power and wireless connection exist over a decade. The variety of the devices and communication protocols as well as the lack of standards for their manufacturing make building of smart homes challenging task and leads to a need for implementation of integration frameworks. The paper addresses this challenge by proposing an IoT Framework for integration of short range devices, called smartFW. The smartFW framework acts as mediator between integration platforms used by the end users to control their smart homes and the connected devices in those homes. It has a flexible architecture allowing to be enriched with new application and communication protocols to enable integration of wide range of devices. The smartFW framework is based on the OSGi standard and currently supports Zigbee, EnOcean, KNX, X10, Z-Wave device communication protocols as well as Coap, MQTT and XAMPP application protocols.",

abstract="In order to achieve the capacity and geographic scope required by IoT applications, service providers should explore mutually-beneficial modes of collaboration such as through cooperative packet forwarding by IoT nodes and cooperative gatewaying through fixed backhauls. To promote such resource pooling while minimizing negative impact on collaborating providers, we developed a transport-layer approach that combines multipath techniques with less-than-best effort (LBE) congestion control methods to enable IoT nodes to opportunistically scavenge for idle bandwidth across multiple paths. Initial tests using TCP-LP and LEDBAT congestion control algorithms on scavenging secondary flows show that this desired functionality can be achieved, while our use of standard TCP congestion control on primary flows ensures that IoT nodes are guaranteed at least one flow that can compete for fair share of the network capacity.",

Hence, in this paper, a novel, adaptable, and secure intelligent smart card framework for integrating IoT and cloud computing is proposed. Elliptic Curve Cryptography is used to ensure complete protection against the security risks. This model ensures security and realizes the vision of ``one intelligent smart card for any applications and transactions'' anywhere, anytime with one unique ID.

abstract="This paper presents an analysis for the challenges and opportunities for the definition of a solution for traceability, tracking and monitoring based on Future Internet of Things to transport of goods, which require an item-level continuous monitoring solution, such as the case of perishable goods, food, medicines and dangerous goods due to the specific needs of these products in terms of environment status (humidity, lighting and temperature) during the transport, in order to preserve its integrity before, during and after the transport process. For that reason, this work describes a particular use case focused on the implementation of the solution for careful monitoring of blood bags, since this requires the communication with the items in order to control the temperature in the bags to detect that it has not been out of range, and control during the transport the temperature in the trailer in order to avoid that situation. This analysis is based on the Internet of Things to support global connectivity through the Future Internet for each one of the items, and on the Web of Things to support the monitoring of the item status and access to services at anytime during the transportation of goods through Embedded Web Services (RESTful).",

Even though the methods and technology used in a leakage localization are based on only one kind of sensor, therefore the leakage is not identified until the water has risen above the surface. Due to physical constraint and unique feature of water distribution network designing effectively identification of leakage is very difficult. This paper incorporates idea to propose a new effective practical approach to collect the information from the sensor and after the analysis and computation of that data; information is communicated using any technology like Bluetooth, wireless network, wired network etc. which will be helpful to fire some important decision and based on this valuable decision, leakage control parameter can be controlled using Internet.

abstract="Adoption of the pervasive and ubiquitous computing paradigm is increasing. One application of this paradigm is Ambient Assistive Living where ICT-based assistive services are deployed in an environment. In this study, a Smart Home in a Box (SHIB) has been devised as an AAL solution. This SHIB relies upon Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as thermal vision sensors, within an environment to function. Each SHIB deployment consists of IoT devices taken from a common pool of devices. The exact device manifest of each SHIB deployment will change as dictated by end-user requirements. Additionally, this pool will grow and expand when devices are removed or added from previous SHIB deployments. To efficiently manage this pool of devices, and SHIB deployments, a remote management solution is required. Current remote management solutions have a range of deficiencies that render them unsuitable for use with the current SHIB platform. To address these deficiencies, a secure mechanism to manage the IoT devices has been devised. This paper presents this mechanism and evaluates its applicability to SHIB deployments. The evaluation focused on assessing the security of the mechanism and the viability of its Low-Power Wireless Wide-Area Network-based communications. This evaluation showed that the proposed solution was reliable and suitable for the intended deployment scenario. An extended evaluation and system improvements have been identified and proposed within future work.",

abstract="New technologies are promising us many upsides like enhanced health, convenience, productivity, safety, and more useful data, information and knowledge for people and organizations. The potential downsides are challenges to personal privacy, over-hyped expectations, increasing technological complexity that boggles us. Our point is this change requires scientific discussion from the point of management, leadership and organizations -- that is, it is time to discuss the meaning of these challenges seriously also in terms of existing traditions of management science. This review type article discusses the nature and role of the Internet of Things (IoT), Big Data and other key technological waves of ubiquitous revolution vis-{\'a}-vis the existing knowledge on management, organizations and knowledge management practices in organizations. Recent changes in the fields of robotics, artificial intelligence and automation technology indicate that all kinds of intelligence and smartness are increasing and organizational cultures are going to change indicating fast changes in the field of modern management and management sciences. Organizational processes form the base for the knowledge-based decision-making. Developing and utilizing smart solutions -- like the utilization of Big Data -- emphasize the importance of open system thinking. Digitalized services can for instance create new interfaces between service providers and users. Service users create social value while they are participating in co-producing activities. Hence, the IoT and Big Data undoubtedly strengthen the role of participation in service production, service economy, innovativeness in-between organizations (as a joint processes) and leadership models incorporated in service-dominant --logic. Moreover, IoT, Big Data, and especially digitalization bring about the renaissance of knowledge in decision-making.",

abstract="In a wireless sensor networks (WSNs), there is a need of constant information access from the nodes, as the real-time data might never again be accessed. Thus, users are allowed to access the nodes in the real-time as and when required. The user authentication plays an indispensable part in this communication. Recently, Farash etÂ al. proposed an efficient user authentication scheme for WSNs. Though their scheme is very efficient, we identify that their scheme is vulnerable to off-line password guessing attack, off-line identity guessing attack, stolen smart card attack and user impersonation attack. As a result, we feel that there is a great need to improve Farash etÂ al.'s scheme to present a secure communication protocol. In this paper, we propose a secure and lightweight user authentication and key agreement scheme for distributed WSN, which will also be handy in taking care of the Internet of Things (IoT). The lightweight property of our proposed scheme can be useful in resource-constrained architecture of WSNs. In addition, our scheme has merit to change dynamically the user's password locally without the help of the base station or gateway node. Furthermore, our scheme supports dynamic nodes addition, after the initial deployment of nodes in the existing sensor network. We prove the authentication property of our scheme using Burrows-Abadi-Needham (BAN) logic. The simulation results using the automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA) tool shows the security of the proposed scheme against replay and man-in-the middle attacks.",

Human beings are surrounded with physical objects. Is there a way so that these surrounding objects become part of the human community and the answer is YES: Internet of Things, where everything is connected to everything else. But connecting the ``Things'' is not just the answer we are looking to. In this paper, we are trying to propose a framework which does not tell that the things are mere an abstraction but also they are ``intelligent'' enough like human beings, they have the intelligence to take decision on their own, and they can also post their sentiments on social networks like human beings.

abstract="The Internet of Agents (IoA) is an emerging field of research that aims to combine the advantages of multi-agent systems and Internet of Things (IoT), by adding autonomy and smartness to, traditionally, naive things used in IoT. IoA can be used to interconnect agents of different multi-agent systems through web-like technologies or using Internet-like architecture. Trust management can be considered an essential component of successful interactions between autonomous agents in IoA, especially when agents cannot assure that potential interaction partners share the same core beliefs, or make accurate statements regarding their competencies and abilities. To date, most research in trust modeling has focused on mechanisms for agents to model the trustworthiness of potential interaction partners, to decide about which of them to interact with. However, slight consideration has been paid for going beyond trust evaluation to outline actions for directing trustees, instead of trustors, to build a higher level of trust and have a greater impact on the results of interactions. Reaching a higher degree of trust can be challenging, especially when explicit feedback is not available. This paper presents a trust establishment model that uses implicit feedback from trustors to modify the behavior of trustees to build a higher level of trust and have a greater impact on the results of interactions. The proposed model is evaluated through simulation, and results indicate that trustees empowered with our proposal have higher chances to be selected as interaction partners when such selection is based on trust.",

Thereby, TEPANOM defines a scalable network management solution for the Internet of Things, which addresses the security requirements, and allows an easy, and transparent support for the management, which are highly desirable and necessary features for the successful of the solutions based on the Internet of things. The proposed protocol has been instanced for the use case of a fire alarm management system, and successfully evaluated with the tools from the Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocols and Applications (AVISPA) framework.",

abstract="Communication technologies play an important role in any wireless network. The networks comprise on energy constraint devices require low power communication technologies. Internet of Things (IoT) is a new and progressing concept that provides connectivity to the Internet via smart sensing devices to attain identification and management in a heterogeneous connectivity environment. Various communication technologies for Wireless Personal Area Networks (WPAN) like IoT are available presenting several properties. IoT concept involves all heterogeneous objects around us communicating with each other locally and via internet globally. Such kind of network poses several challenges and requirements for choosing the best amongst the available communication technologies. This paper is intended to present a critical study of IoT requirement, issues and challenges and propose the best or suitable amongst the available communication technologies.",

abstract="Wireless Sensor Network is a promising technology thanks to its numerous beneficial applications. The recent trend towards Web of Things leverages substantial web technologies and toolkits, which greatly simplify the chore of WSN application development. However, the complex web server and heavy HTTP communications impose difficulties on portability of WSN applications and node's resources management. In order to provide a lightweight web integration and uniform data representation, we propose to employ XMPP, an open standard formalized by IETF, to build instant messaging and presence service for wireless sensor nodes. In this paper, we develop a scalable and flexible XMPP sensor bot to integrate WSN into generic XMPP architecture. We also design two lightweight XMPP extensions for sensor node representation and task configuration. The efficient XML expression in our extension protocol can squeeze the payload into a single IEEE 802.15.4 packet and does not cause XMPP message fragmentation. Our solution works directly on MAC layer without the need of TCP/IP stack. Based on our sensor bot, we propose a novel application for product validation and customer behavior analysis with RFID/NFC technology on smartphones to demonstrate a new context-aware service.",

abstract="The main purpose of this article is to test IoT management system based on SDN core network, as well as interaction IoT traffic with SDN-switches. To conduct investigation of management system and network infrastructure behavior we carried out several IoT traffic tests, which were generated based on partnership project oneM2M specification. In this work, we considered ``Smart city'' model for Central district of Saint-Petersburg (Russia). During the testing of the network infrastructure were identified several parameters such as number of simultaneously supported sessions by the Mikrotik switch using different transport protocols, was proposed a recommendation for dynamically changing virtual buffers. During the testing of the IoT management system, we define reliability of IoT data management service for determined equipment in traffic conditions of the ``Smart City''. Also, we estimate relationship between RTT parameter using various IoT protocols and heterogeneous traffic in conjunction with ``Smart city'' segment in SDN network. In order to investigate the influence of the SDN network on the RTT traffic parameter of a large number of IoT and the condition of its transmission in conjunction with heterogeneous traffic in the network, a full-scale experiment was conducted on the developed model, which in turn reflected a possible distribution scheme of a certain monitoring and control system for the Central District Saint-Petersburg. The aim of the study is also to consider the possibility of implementing the IoT data management service as a central management system for monitoring urban ecological parameters in a dense buildings environment.",

But fulfilling these requirements is getting more and more complex in a dynamically changing logistic environment. There is a shift from traditional supply chains to open supply networks. Long-lasting business relationships are overrun by short-term business connections. The highly dynamic logistic markets and the advancing complexity of logistic networks require new methods, products and services. Aspects such as flexibility, adaptability and proactivity gain importance and can only be achieved by integration of new technologies. While problem initiated approaches usually only lead to minor improvements, technology driven approaches can evoke more radical changes. The technology driven approach that is used to define Smart Products and Smart Services is utilized and extended to define ``Smart Logistics''. Within the paper a definition of Smart Logistics is given. Additionally current technical components of Smart Logistics are specified.",

The first step towards developing such a framework would be to build a classification mechanism which can identify the security capabilities or parameters of the different entities comprising an IoT system. In this paper we describe one such mechanism which can take user input to classify the different components of a complex system and thereby determine their capability to support security mechanisms of different degrees. This in turn would enable designers to decide what kind of security protocols they need to adopt to achieve end-to-end security for the whole system.",

abstract="This paper presents our work in progress on enabling computerized reasoning capability in machine-to-machine communication scenarios for the Networked Society (or Internet of Things). Such reasoning capability is about drawing high-level conclusions on the situation in real time based on raw data streams generated by various sources. There are challenges posed by the dynamic and heterogenous availability of raw data coming from different sources, as well as the stringent time constraints for conclusions to be made. Our goal hence is to make machine-based reasoning processes time-efficient, resource-efficient, and scalable. We present an approach that addresses the challenges by decomposing a reasoning process into two stages: ``shallow reasoning'' and ``deep reasoning''. The former deals with the dynamic and heterogenous availability of raw data from different sources, while the latter executes semantic reasoning with a lightweight workload that has been reduced by the former. We present our prototype implementation of a reasoning system that adopts the proposed approach in a proactive healthcare use case. Performance evaluation is currently ongoing to verify the effectiveness of our approach.",

abstract="The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) over the past few years enabled a lot of application domains. Due to the increasing number of IoT connected devices, the amount of generated data is increasing too. Processing huge amounts of data is complex due to the continuously running situation recognition algorithms. To overcome these problems, this paper proposes an approach for optimizing the usage of situation recognition algorithms in Internet of Things domains. The key idea of our approach is to select important data, based on situation recognition purposes, and to execute the situation recognition algorithms after all relevant data have been collected. The main advantage of our approach is that situation recognition algorithms will not be executed each time new data is received, thus allowing the reduction of the situation recognition algorithms execution frequency and saving computational resources.",

In this paper we focus on the current developments and discussions on designing Semantic Sensor Web, particularly, we advocate the idea of semantic annotation with the existing authoritative data published on the semantic Web. Through illustrative examples, we demonstrate how rule-based reasoning can be performed over the sensor observation and measurement data and linked data to derive additional or approximate knowledge. Furthermore, we discuss the association between sensor data, the semantic Web, and the social Web which enable construction of context-aware applications and services, and contribute to construction of a networked knowledge framework.",

abstract="The evolved vision of the Internet-of-Things predicts tremendous growth in the number of connected human-unattended objects over the following years. However, existing wireless network protocols were not originally designed for such excessive numbers of nodes. Therefore, currently deployed networking solutions are not optimized for Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. To bridge in this gap, IEEE 802.16m cellular technology targets extensive improvements to support M2M communications. As such, performance assessment of an 802.16m-based network with respect to the expected M2M scenarios is topical. In particular, the contention-based procedure for network admission control is very likely to become a bottleneck for the entire system. Therefore, we focus performance assessment of the standardized collision resolution algorithm, used in the random access channel, with respect to M2M. In particular, this paper addresses a Smart Grid use case, where a large number of devices access the network within a relatively short period of time. We discuss specific performance requirements that apply to the considered scenario. Then, an evaluation methodology to investigate the adaptability of the 802.16m system is presented. Finally, we conclude on the capability of the 802.16m technology to support an excessive number of human-unattended devices.",

abstract="With the immense growth of information gathering, sharing and processing in the world through sophisticated smart gadgets, it is therefore paramount that the Cloud would be better managed through other paradigms such as Fog computing and Information Centric Network (ICN). These would drive the need for the shift to the Internet of Everything (IoE). Jacobson et al., Cisco and Gantz et al., in different studies forecasted the engrossment of IP addresses and as such these along other vital reports have necessitated the need of replacing IP addresses with names through the Content Centric Networking. Ciscos' report submitted the forecast of smart gadgets out numbering the world population soon. This paper therefore presents a conceptual framework of introducing Information Centric Networking (ICN) as API to Ubiquitous computing. Taking ICN cache at the edge nodes through Fog computing technique (as off-network cache) by referring object with names in lieu of IP addresses. This practice will make access to information residing on the Cloud in the Internet of Everything closer to the user. Fog in this paper is used as edge processing node in the content store to depict the caching that makes the ICN achievable off-path. Fog concept proposed the computing, processing and storage at the edges (devices) with the added advantage of heterogeneity for Internet of Things (IoT).",

abstract="Service ontology models have been applied to many application domains to facilitate the semantic rich specifications of various types of services, including the business processes, health care, manufacturing processes, etc. Recently, many service models for the Internet of Things (IoT) domain have been proposed. However, these models are still mostly following the thoughts of software services. In this paper, we discuss some differences of the IoT services from the software services and the requirements in service modeling for IoT services due to these differences. We also extend the existing software service model to support the specification of the IoT services and things.",

abstract="People barely know what they eat and drink: product labels are written with small characters and with a difficult terminology. As a result, people spend too much time reading labels or avoid reading them at all. To connect food data with people we design of a food IoT (Internet of Things) scenario, where a smart cart tells us if the food product we are about to buy meet our preferences or not. In particular, we first perform a real-world study to understand consumers' behavior while they shop; then we design a food IoT scenario and we use current technologies to investigate its feasibility. Results show that people would appreciate a tool able to help them connecting with food data and also show that current technologies are sufficient to create a food IoT scenario.",

One cornerstone property of QLM-MI provides the opportunity to subscribe IoT information from any ``Thing'' so as to retrieve it in a deferred way. Subscriptions can be performed to receive a ``continuous'' data flow or can be based on ``client-initiated'' communications. All these features are described in this paper, and then a technical proof-of-concept is provided based on a scenario in the framework of smart home.",

Due to growing population and urbanization, various life style health problems are on the rise. Majority of the healthcare devices work in silos. Hence health vitals recorded remain locally stored and enhance the chances of data getting loss. By interconnecting these devices, we could maintain the health records centrally and derive insights. This could be incorporated with the advanced wireless technology. Smartphones could be leveraged for smart functionalities like voice recognition and Google services available.

Information from health IoT devices and services is sensitive and confidential. While many existing works have proposed enhancements and security prospects for individual devices and components in IoT ecosystems, they still do not address the underlying challenge which is the lack of sufficient security within systems. Effective security has to be built-in, not patched upon. To efficaciously tackle the challenge in distributed IoT systems, we present a security context framework which applies adaptive security contexts to properly track data of interest. The proposed solution can achieve accountability and track information propagation, involving devices, services and parties who have responsibility and potential legal liability. This could help leverage not just technical but also policy and legal aspects to enable health IoT adoption.",

A vast amount of water is being wasted without being consumed anywhere due to existing ineffective water supply system.

Besides that consumers embrace potential IoT benefits to them, they are much more concerned about the security and privacy of their data. Since, the increased connectivity between devices and the internet in IoT presents security and privacy related challenges, and the data breach of sensitive personal information can be exploited to harm the consumers; the trust of these consumers on the IoT can be tampered. The success of IoT ultimately depends upon the consumer perceptions about security and privacy in IoT and the level of digital trust of its consumers. Since trust has been an important element to influence consumer's behavior, thus, it can be stimulated by increased consumer perceptions of both security and privacy of IoT. In this paper we contribute to identify the evolving features of IoT and identify important security and privacy requirements from consumer perspectives. We propose a conceptual security and privacy model and highlighting important threats and challenges on various stages of this model.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) enables Smart Cities with novel services. Waste collection in Smart Cities becomes a dynamic process with the proliferation of sensors and actuators embedded on real waste bins. Heterogeneous fleets of trucks are used for efficient waste collection exploiting the diverse road network. In this paper we propose a novel approach by incorporating Low Capacity Trucks (LCTs) and High Capacity Trucks (HCTs). However, HCTs are serving as Mobile Depots (MDs) which are cost efficient and decongest traffic in Smart Cities. A detailed system overview illustrates the architecture of the proposed approach. We also propose novel algorithms which support dynamic waste collection with MDs. Scheduling and routing are transformed to dynamic models. Specifically, we propose a novel scheduling algorithm while we customize an existing routing algorithm. The models where experimentally evaluated with real and synthetic data from the city of St. Petersburg, Russia. The results were promising and proved that the incorporation of MDs is efficient for waste collection in IoT-enabled Smart Cities. Finally, we perform an economic analysis in order to define the economic impact of the proposed solution to the municipality budget for an ownership cost for a period of five years; in which the proposed solution proved to be cost efficient.",

During the series of experiments there was noticed the LoRa radio modules performance variation of different parameters (Bandwidth, Spreading Factor and Coding Rate), which have affected on the time and quality of image transmission. For image compression were used JPEG and JPEG 2000 methods, which have allowed to achieve an acceptable compression and image reconstruction while transmitting in the low-speed network. In the course of the experiment, the images were transferred from a camera mounted on a quadrocopter at distance of several kilometers. We considered such parameters as the time of data transfer, packet loss, estimation of the images quality obtained on the basis of subjective and objective methods. For voice compression, the A-law method was used, which allowed to compress the frame size by 4 times. Experiments of real-time speech transmission were conducted in different languages and evaluated by the experts. During the results analyzing there were defined the lower subjective score for Arabic, and the higher scores for English and Vietnamese. In conclusion, this article provides the results of the quantitative and qualitative dimensions evaluation and presents directions for the further research.",

abstract="Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) which is a mature identification and tracking technology recently is picking up its momentum with the emergency of a highly hyped ``Internet of Things'' (IOT). The ultimate goal of IOT is to let human and objects seamlessly talk to each other via the Internet. It finds great impacts on our lifestyles in various applications such as supply chain management, access control security, mobile health-care, etc. In response to this technology trend and market demands, a high level infrastructure called EPC (Electronic Product Code) network with Object Naming Service has been proposed that rides on the future IPv6 Internet. In order to enable the operation of EPC network, auxiliary mechanisms such as privacy and security protection, context-aware capabilities, middleware and interoperable data semantics are needed. In this paper we propose a prototype of wireless communication system incorporated with Internet capability, namely Internet RFID. In particular, this paper shows the preliminary design, implementation and testing of the Internet RFID prototype in a client-server environment. As an experiment, we implemented a typical RFID system with the additional feature of distance finding that can track and monitor access control, and at the same time a database located remotely in a Web Server is updated. Users can query the Web database server in real-time about the location of the client. The hardware module consists mainly of the construction of two micro-controller systems: one for the user card and the other one for the station transceiver controller. Recommendations are provided at the end of the paper for future development.",

abstract="Due to protocols such as 6LoWPAN and CoAP, wireless sensor nodes have become an integral part of the Internet. While this makes their data available on the Internet, it still remains a strictly devicecentric approach. However, one is usually interested in the phenomena observed by one or more devices and not in the sensors themselves. To bridge this gap, we introduce and evaluate the concept of Service-Level Semantic Entities (SLSE). They support the automatic semantic annotation of real-world objects based on networked sensor devices. SLSE continuously collect observations of sensors attached to some objects, and aggregates them to descriptions of the objects themselves. It then makes this augmented object data available as (semantic) linked data. This removes several layers of indirection in the semantic data, and allows to directly access properties of real-world objects.",

abstract="Nanonetworks is one of the most dynamically developing areas in the field of telecommunications. Nanonetworking promises new opportunities in different fields of science and technology. However along with obvious advantages, the implementation of nanonetwork applications can cause a number of problems for the functioning of modern telecommunication networks. One of them is a large number of data packets generated by nanonetwork applications. In this regard, the actual problem is the study of traffic nanoceramic applications and its impact on traditional telecommunication networks. The article deals with simulation of traffic from sensor nanetwork applications. The paper presents results of nanonetwork applications traffic simulation. Simulation based on the traffic models developed for M2M. In the simulation considered the possibility of gateway working in two modes: without processing messages received from nanonetwork and with it. Typical architecture of nanonetwork medical applications involving the use of remote Internet servers, was described.

abstract="Security of embedded devices today is a critical requirement for the Internet of Things (IoT) as these devices will access sensitive information such as social security numbers and health records. This makes these devices a lucrative target for attacks exploiting vulnerabilities to inject malicious code or reuse existing code to alter the execution of their software. Existing defense techniques have major drawbacks such as requiring source code or symbolic debugging information, and high overhead, limiting their applicability. In this paper we propose a novel defense technique, DisARM, that protects against both code-injection and code-reuse based buffer overflow attacks by breaking the ability for attackers to manipulate the return address of a function. Our approach operates on arbitrary executable binaries and thus does not require compiler support. In addition it does not require user interactions and can thus be automatically applied. Our experimental results show that our approach incurs low overhead and significantly increases the level of security against both code-injection and code-reuse based attacks.",

Smart home, which provides comfortable living environment to users with advanced technologies, is an important application field in IoT. With a large number of people who live remotely from family members, smart homes should provide not only convenient and comfortable services in a single house, but also mutual communication services to enhance interaction between family members. Unlike usual communication methods such as phone call, email, and chatting tools with human intentions, we propose a remote mutual situation-aware model between smart homes to let users contact with other family members in an unintended way.

The assessment, in real-time, would be useful as most of the times a person is not in presence of health professionals. But own assessment lacks precision and reaction time that could be risky in critical conditions. The pervasiveness of Internet connections and ubiquity of smart devices makes it possible to overcome that limitation. By using sensing capabilities of portable/wearable devices in conjunction with medical knowledge and clinical history it is possible to monitor a person's health status in real-time with reaction mechanisms. The objective is to keep track of collected evidence, and relate with existing knowledge for better assessment.

Emerging with the Internet of Things, new applications are requiring more intelligence on these things, for them to be able to learn about their environment or other connected objects. One such domain of application is for livestock monitoring, in which farmers need to learn about animals, such as percentage of time they spend feeding, the occurrence of diseases, or the percentage of fat on their milk. Furthermore, it is also important to learn about group patterns, such as flocking behaviors, and individual deviations to group dynamics. This paper addresses this problem, by collection and processing each animal location and selecting appropriate metrics on the data, so that behaviors can be learned afterwards using machine learning techniques running on the cloud.",

abstract="Recently Semantic Technology (ST) has been widely applied in many fields such as health care, energy, environmental science, life sciences, national intelligence, and so on. ST can represent the meaning of information explicitly, which helps machines to process and integrate existing information automatically. In this paper, we discuss how to apply ST in precision agriculture. Citrus fertilizing is chosen as an example to show how to build the related semantic knowledge base as well as the citrus disease query system. With the help of ST, the precision agriculture system can play a greater role in increasing yield of citrus and avoiding plant diseases. A general framework of decision-making support system for citrus production is also provided.",

abstract="Devices are becoming increasingly interconnected and increasingly linked to humans beings. The Internet of Things (IoT) concept was developed from the following technologies: the internet, wireless networks, and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS). It is currently employed for home and industrial applications. Because of differing requirements, different protocols are used. It works on IP, TCP, and HTTP on TCP protocols through the MQTT, XMPP, DDS, and AMQP protocols. IoT evolved from the convergence of MEMS wireless technologies (like RFID and NFC) and the internet. The IoT concept is used in M2M applications like power, gas, and oil utilities' transmission and transport. In this paper, we use OPNET simulation to look at two scenarios and gather traffic data - received and average - for DB query, FTP and Email. We propose an optional addressing method for smart-things to make up the smart world enabling the transmission and analysis of data automatically.",

abstract="Household appliances are set to become highly intelligent, smart and networked devices in the near future. Systematically deployed on the Internet of Things (IoT), they would be able to form complete energy consuming, producing, and managing ecosystems. Smart systems are technically very heterogeneous, and standardized interfaces on a sensor and device level are therefore needed. However, standardization in IoT has largely focused at the technical communication level, leading to a large number of different solutions based on various standards and protocols, with limited attention to the common semantics contained in the message data structures exchanged at the technical level. The Smart Appliance REFerence ontology (SAREF) is a shared model of consensus developed in close interaction with the industry and with the support of the European Commission. It is published as a technical specification by ETSI and provides an important contribution to achieve semantic interoperability for smart appliances. This paper builds on the success achieved in standardizing SAREF and presents SAREF4EE, an extension of SAREF created in collaboration with the EEBus and Energy@Home industry associations to interconnect their (different) data models. By using SAREF4EE, smart appliances from different manufacturers that support the EEBus or Energy@Home standards can easily communicate with each other using any energy management system at home or in the cloud.",

The goal of this paper is first to introduce our approach for an autonomic Middleware-level QoS management of IoT systems. As a contribution at the second maturity level of the autonomic computing paradigm such as defined by IBM, it is then to propose and validate, within an emulation testbed platform, a proof of concept-oriented architecture of a monitoring component allowing detecting QoS degradation symptoms.

The inherent closed-loop responsiveness and decision making of IoT applications makes them ideal candidates for using low latency and scalable stream processing platforms. Distributed Stream Processing Systems (DSPS) are becoming essential components of any IoT stack, but the efficacy and performance of contemporary DSPS have not been rigorously studied for IoT data streams and applications. Here, we develop a benchmark suite and performance metrics to evaluate DSPS for streaming IoT applications. The benchmark includes 13 common IoT tasks classified across functional categories and forming micro-benchmarks, and two IoT applications for statistical summarization and predictive analytics that leverage various dataflow patterns of DSPS. These are coupled with stream workloads from real IoT observations on smart cities. We validate the benchmark for the popular Apache Storm DSPS, and present the results.",

Though things are connected with various methods easily, it attracts network attackers who exploit these open and convenient network connections in order to obtain unjustified information and benefits or to subvert various IoT systems. Especially, Denial of Service (DoS) attack becomes a serious problem on IoT system where huge number of devices are connected to. These devices are usually connected to IoT gateways in order to send packets to Internet. However, currently the impact of DoS attack on an IoT gateway, which has various interfaces such as wireless LAN interface and wired LAN interface, is not well examined. In this paper, we assess the impact of DoS attack on an IoT gateway with various scenarios. We implemented a prototype of an IoT gateway which has wired and wireless network interfaces by using Raspberry Pi, OpenWRT, and OVS (Open vSwitch). With this prototype, we evaluated various DoS attack scenarios on this IoT gateway. Through this evaluation, we observed the severity of DoS attack on IoT gateways, especially for wireless connections.",

abstract="Industrial products quality is more and more expected. As most products may be the organic combination of several kinds of materials, materials databases are essential to the industrial engineering. With the new IT technologies, cloud computing and Internet of Things, the materials databases have the new development path. In this paper, we proposed a new cloud platform framework, material cloud (MatCloud), of lifetime cycle assessment for engineering materials. The proposed MatCloud platform is based on the requirement of materials science/engineering and cloud computing. By the MatCloud platform, we may overcome the limitation of the traditional materials databases. The key technologies and the prospect of the MatCloud platform were detailed analyzed. And the MatCloud platform will be gradually improved in the future.",

Cities are collecting large amounts of data from traditional sources such as registries and surveys and from non-traditional sources such as the Internet of Things, and are considered an important field of experimentation to generate public value with big data. The establishment of a city data infrastructure can drive such a development. This paper describes two key challenges for such an infrastructure: platform federation and data quality, and how these challenges are addressed in the ongoing research project CPaaS.io.",

Safe and reliable operation of IoT connected devices is of paramount importance and thus, security and privacy is a foundational enabler for IoT. In this paper, we arrive at a synthesis methodology for the IoT and demonstrate how information flow among the connected devices using a three tier architecture enables us to assess the required security and privacy of the IoT based on the given security and privacy capabilities of the components. Our methodology uses a recent information security model called RWFM (Readers-Writers Flow Model) and shows how flexible approaches of synthesis of IoT through frameworks like Django can be integrated to realize the security/privacy requirements of the IoT. We demonstrate how the methodology concretely enables us to derive the constraints to be satisfied by the underlying components and enabled communications.

It combines the concept of neighborhood watch communities with IoT technology in order to develop a Smart Home security community. Therefore, (1) this paper shows a positive influence of community features in the case of non-intrusive devices. Furthermore, (2) it points out the influence of personal relationships on perceived security.

Additionally, we extend our recent contributions in favor of a separation of concerns in multimedia systems, in which synchronization support can operate independently of other features. More specifically, the main contribution of this paper is the discussions about how media synchronization challenges can enroll the Internet of Things research area, where distributed sensors and actuators are specified as media objects and can be related to usual hypermedia objects, all synchronized in time and space, in what we call the ``Synchronism of Things''.",

Current health services help user define goals ``Reduce weight'' but do not provide interfaces for users to define goals as ``Stay Happy''. Lot of existing research has focused on sensing user mood classification based on device data but there is limited research that has focused to diagnose and heal depression. A conventional method of doctors detecting depression is based on Hamilton scale of depression with a set of questions and is an intrusive method to probe depression patients. IoT devices are slowly gaining popularity and huge data that is generated from these devices can be leveraged to determine user emotional health. Proposed method attempts to analyze IoT device data and calculate user depression scale and recommends relevant social communication with user social contacts (Friends, Family Members). Identifying precise social contacts and recommending actions and content to recover from early stages of depression is one of the goals of the proposed system. Method recommends relevant social contacts based on current depression score. Proposed system tries to monitor user's emotional state and more tries to act as preventive health assistant to correct emotional states in early stages and avoids user moving to advanced stages of depression.",

They are being used in domains such as infrastructure management, and medical and healthcare systems, where business interests and our security and privacy are at stake. Yet, security mechanisms have been appallingly neglected on many IoT platforms. In this paper we present a secure access control mechanism for extremely lightweight embedded microcontrollers. Being based on Sancus, a hardware-only Trusted Computing Base and Protected Module Architecture for the embedded domain, our mechanism allows for multiple software modules on an IoT-node to securely share resources. We implement and evaluate our approach for two application scenarios, a shared memory system and a shared flash drive. Our implementation is based on a Sancus-enabled TI MSP430 microcontroller. We show that our mechanism can give high security guarantees at small runtime overheads and a moderately increased size of the Trusted Computing Base.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) is an interconnection of tiny real-world objects using sensor, actuators, and software's designed for exchanging data and controlling them. It invades business landscape on massive scale integrating heterogeneous devices. Some of the application includes media, environmental monitoring, infrastructure and energy management, medical, healthcare system, and transportation. Earlier, in these applications, the primary issue is handling efficient communication among the interconnected devices to have an extended network lifetime. Nowadays, as data grows rapidly in the IoT, security and privacy is also a major issue to be concentrated in these applications to reduce vulnerabilities. Recent studies show that the existing IP security protocols and algorithm have technical limitation in applying it to the context Internet of Things. In particular, when a new device enters to an existing secured network, the network should ensure that the new device is authenticated and authorized properly with respect to the properties of existing network. Otherwise, similar to other network, IoT network also will be subjected to various attacks such as physical attacks, service disruption attacks, data attacks, and denial-of-service attacks. Hence, in this work, an algorithm to authenticate and authorize when a new device gets added to the existing network is proposed. The algorithm is tested for various attacks and the results are proven to be efficient and secure.",

abstract="The high cost of healthcare services, the aging population and the increase of chronic disease are becoming a global concern. Several studies have indicated the need for strategies to minimize the process of hospitalization and the effects related to the high cost of patient care. A promising trend in healthcare is to move the routines of medical checks from a hospital (hospital-centric) to the patient's home (home-centric). Moreover, recent advances in microelectronics, wireless, sensing and information have boosted the advent of a revolutionary model involving systems and communication technology, enabling smarter ways to ``make things happen''. This new paradigm, known as the Internet of Things (IoT), has a broad applicability in several areas, including healthcare. The full application of this paradigm in healthcare area is a common hope because it will allow hospitals to operate more efficiently and patients to receive better treatment. With the use of this technology-based healthcare approach, there is an unprecedented opportunity to improve the quality and efficiency of the medical treatment and consequently improve the wellness of the patients, as well as a better application of government financial resources. Based on this context, this paper aims to describe a review to comprehend the current state and future trends for healthcare applications based on IoT infrastructure, and also to find areas for further investigations.",

abstract="IoT, Internet of Things, is a major revolution dragging along new requirements that impact the network {\&} IT infrastructure under development. Actually, the network infrastructure is evolving to embed virtualization techniques to gain in flexibility. For this purpose, new architectures are drawn-up such as the one proposed by the ETSI NFV. In this article, we first highlight a new business model: the IoT store. We then show how it benefits from the network {\&} IT infrastructure services. After presenting the main actors of this business model, we actually provide the overview of an NFV-based architecture that fulfills new IoT requirements. We thus show that the move towards a network {\&} IT infrastructure benefiting of Cloud and virtualization solutions can highly serve the IoT deployment.",

abstract="IoT's presence is increasingly felt. There are already more connected devices to the internet than total human population and sales are starting to rise. As there is extensive research ongoing in order to propose a global architecture to build IoT applications, the domain will rise as soon as a common solution will be widespread. Further, we would need to integrate IoT applications into the legacy data processing solutions. Business Process Model, for example, is a common concept used to build and compose software. Could the Internet of Things become an active shareholder in this approach? The Internet of Things, unlike BPM (which is more static), has specific constraints and peculiar organisations based on its dynamicity and heterogeneity. We propose, in this paper, a gateway to adapt our own IoT platform to the needs of the BPM approach and we also try to analyse the difficulties that may arise therein.",

abstract="Nutrition plays a key role in both the prevention of several critical diseases and lead an healthier life in the modern society. In order to analyse household's eating habits in the Italian scenario, authors propose the design of an innovative system called ``Smart Shelve''. This system consists in a robotic structure integrable with various appliances, such as refrigerators, which allows to receive and deliver several types of foods in order to control their daily consumption. Smart Shelve is equipped with external optical sensors for food recognition, while inside it is composed of several food compartments in which load cells measure the weight of each type of food. The system is capable to warn the users who have recently conducted an incorrect style. The system is also able to send the acquired food consumption information to the cloud in order to provide statistical services regarding the nutrition style of clusters of users localized in a specific geographical area (e.g. district or region).",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) based solutions and services may be used to support and extend the independent living of older adults in their living environments by responding to real needs of caregivers, service providers and public authorities. Telemedicine and telehealth platforms areÂ among the various types of IoT services that could support the provision of health services. Current Health Technology Assessment (HTA) models that are used for the evaluation of telehealth and telemedicine services do not consider IoT aspects. HTA models would ideally need to be extended to include IoT platforms, for an optimal introduction of IoT in everyday provision of health and care services. This paper presents an initial adaptation of the Model for Assessment of Telemedicine (MAST) for IoT Telemedicine services based on a literature review of IoT, telemedicine and telehealth services characteristics. MAST involves assessment of outcomes within the following seven domains: Health problem and characteristics of the application, Safety, Clinical effectiveness, Patient perspectives, Economic aspects, Organizational aspects, Socio-cultural, ethical and legal aspects. The domains of the characteristics of the application, socio-cultural, safety and ethical and legal aspects were identified as those to be adapted to cover new challenges associated to IoT services.",

In the current era of technology, we need efficient methods and solutions able to structure, annotate, share and make sense of the IoT data. We assumed that Things are basically active participants in information processes by exchanging data and information ``sensed'' about the environment. Semantics provide unambiguous machine-interpretable descriptions for data related to Things. In our methodology we proposed to encode sensor and observation data annotations through Semantic Web technologies and to embed them within devices. Moreover, we transformed such annotations to semantic descriptions, by using the cloud-based ThingSpeak middleware. The obtained descriptions are expected to compound a shared RDF Knowledge Base, useful to improve integration and communication processes between different networks.",

abstract="The smart fridge has often been considered a prototypical example of applications of the Internet of Things for the home. However, very little research has been conducted on functions desired by prospective users, and how users will eventually use the fridge. A simulation of a smart fridge was developed and tested within a controlled laboratory between-subjects experiment with 105 participants. Four different assistance functions were tested. It was found that generally a smart fridge is evaluated as moderately useful, easy to use and people would tend to buy it, if it was already available. Emotional responses differed between the assistance functions. Displaying information on durability of products, as well as giving feedback on nutrition health and economics are the most appreciated applications. Structurally, overall usefulness ratings of the device are the strongest predictors for the intention to use a smart fridge, but the emotional response to the product was also an important explanatory variable. Results are not influenced by technical competence, gender, or sense of presence in the simulation. Regression models confirmed that the simulation-based results explained 20{\%} more variance in product acceptance than written scenarios. An outlook is given on future questions to be answered using the simulation.",

However, leveraging the IoT within software applications raises tremendous challenges from the networking upÂ to the application layers, in particular due to the ultra-large scale, the extreme heterogeneity and the dynamics of the IoT. This paper more specifically explores how the service-oriented architecture paradigm may be revisited to address challenges posed by the IoT for the development of distributed applications. Drawing from our past and ongoing work within the MiMove team at Inria Paris, the paper discusses the evolution of the supporting middleware solutions spanning the introduction of: probabilistic protocols to face scale, cross-paradigm interactions to face heterogeneity, and streaming-based interactions to support the inherent sensing functionality brought in by the IoT.",

Although the huge amount of sensitive data these systems deal with and expose to the external world, security and privacy issues are surprisingly not taken into consideration. The aim of this paper is to raise some key security and privacy issues that home health monitor systems should face with. The analysis is based on a real world monitoring sensor network for healthcare built in the context of the eCare@Home project.",

abstract="Several convenience and efficiency applications have been proposed as part of recent vehicular networks (a.k.a. VANET) activities. Among these proposals, eHealth has often been studied as a time-critical application to emulate an ambulance. The Vehicle-To-Infrastructure (V2I) setting is the typical communication scenario to carry out the data in this case. From a user perspective, combining vehicular networking and eHealth to record and transmit a patient's vital signs is a special telemedicine application that helps hospital resident professionals to optimally prepare the patient's admittance. The current proposal pro-vides an IPv6 vehicular platform which integrates eHealth devices and allows sending captured user health-related data to a Personal Health Record (PHR) application server on the IPv6 Internet. The collected data are viewed remotely by a doctor and supports diagnostic decision. The resulting platform is then compared to the state-of-the-art related architectures.",

abstract="Transportation industry is heavily regulated in the United States to ensure passenger safety and low environmental impact. Highways, being the primary mode of transportation, offer an exciting area of research to achieve both objectives. For instance, road markings play an important role in maintaining traffic safety by providing proper guidance to the vehicle drivers. The marking activities require strict control technologies due to the properties of the liquids used that may be hazardous to the driver and to the environment. With this motivation, this paper proposes an environmentally friendly system for paint consumption monitoring and inventory control that keeps track of the utilization rate of the marking liquid (i.e., paint) while the paint trucks are on service. Through this system the paint crew and the decision makers would receive information regarding the amount of paint that is consumed so that refilling would be possible without significant time loss. The system, using a shortest path routing algorithm, directs the truck driver to the nearest refill station and then, if needed, to the nearest customer. The real time information sharing allows accurate billing and real time inventory control. A computer vision system is used to monitor the amount of paint consumption where the collected data are then sent to a multi-network system for real-time communication.",

Since its emergence, the wireless sensor network (WSN) constitutes one of the most important technological developments in the last decade. It has the potential to affect our lifestyle deeply. However, its success relies greatly on a well-defined architecture that will provide scalable, dynamic, and secure basement to its deployment. The IoT-based architectures are intelligent applications that make energy, logistics, industrial control, retail, agriculture, and many other domains ``smarter.'' With emergence of wireless sensor network as Internet of Things is a new revolution of the Internet, that is, rapidly gathering momentum driven by the advancements in sensor networks, mobile devices, wireless communications, and networking and cloud technologies. With rapidly increasing wireless sensor network (WSN)- and internet of thing (IoT)-based services; a lot of data is generated. It is becoming very difficult to manage power constrained small sensors and other data-generating devices. WSN or IoTs enables anything can become part of the Internet and generate data. Moreover, data generation needs to be managed according to its requirements, to create more valuable services.

This is achievable via monitoring patient's vital signs continuously and is often manually done with paper and pen. However, because of the constraints in healthcare resources and the high hospital costs, the patient might not be hospitalized for the whole period of the treatments, which has lead to a demand for in-home or portable EWS systems. Such a personalized EWS system needs to monitor the patient at anytime and anywhere even when the patient is carrying out daily activities. In this paper, we propose a self-aware EWS system which is the reinforced version of the existing EWS systems by using the Internet of Things technologies and the self-awareness concept.

Currently, the Fog is not implemented to the extent that we can submit application requirements to a Fog provider, select returned resources and deploy an application on them. A widely adopted workaround is to deploy Cloud applications that exploit the functionality of IoT and Fog devices. Although Clouds provide virtually unlimited computation power, they could present a bottleneck and unnecessary communication overhead when a huge number of devices needs to be controlled, read or written to.

abstract="A considerable amount of research activities deals with Internet of Things and Smart Cities, by leveraging the continuously growing usage of cloud computing solutions and mobile devices. The pervasivity of mobiles also enables the Mobile Crowd Sensing paradigm, which aims at using mobile-embedded sensors to ease the monitoring of multiple phenomena. The combination of these elements has recently converged into a new sensing model: Sensing as a Service (S2aaS), which is expected to offer novel monitoring approaches in the next years. In this paper, we propose a platform to pave the way for applying S2aaS in urban scenarios by considering both noise and electromagnetic field exposure. Design and implementation choices are discussed, along with privacy-related issues and preliminary monitoring tests conducted at a city in Southern Italy, in order to demonstrate the suitability of our approach.",

The development of software for gateways, using a middleware to handle the different devices demands, is possible in our working scenario, but the maintenance cost of such a solution is high because of software development constraints imposed by hardware and system limitations of the gateway. This paper depicts an SDN approach for smart environments resulted from a refactoring of a previous middleware proposal. Through an instantiation of the refactored middleware in a home network to deliver a health monitoring service the benefits are demonstrated; the benefits regard the digital representation of the physical realm, deployment and maintenance of services, and management of devices and networks.",

The increase in complexity is driven by the efforts to conserve the energy and to enhance the network throughput but it is also caused by the evolution of these technologies toward the integration into the Internet of Things. The results obtained give an overview on the computational resources (computing time and memory size) necessary to perform the usual arithmetic operations using different representations of the operands on multiple platforms. These results are aimed to support the optimal selection of WSN platforms relatively to the computational effort required by specific application as well as the adaptation of the operations performed and of the related operands to a specified platform.",

Internet of Things (IoT), a collection of networked and interacting embedded devices, could provide the necessary infrastructure and enabling technologies to design, develop and deploy smart built-environments. We describe an approach to modeling IoT-based smart built environments that uses a large-scale virtual environment where a building model is aligned with the physical space. This approach takes advantages of affordances and embodied cognition in a large physical space to model user interaction with built spaces. The built space contains `smart objects' with embedded sensors/actuators/controllers (e.g., kitchen appliances). A `smart object' has the corresponding virtual object in the virtual environment. We build on our work on the conceptual design of interaction middleware and context sensitive interaction interoperability frameworks to develop support for a living ecosystem of services, a service framework, to support interactions with a smart built-environment. We illustrate the proposed framework on a case study, a living lab for smart built-environments that includes a kitchen, a living room, a bathroom, an office, and a bedroom.",

It is unreasonable to imagine that the application developers will possess all relevant skills and knowledge related to the domain, physical world, signal processing and deployment infrastructure. This paper presents an method that assists the IoT application developer by (i) providing an annotated repository of algorithms, (ii) recommending algorithms depending on the signal type to reduce the effort required from a signal processing expert, and (iii) providing a framework to execute the IoT application thereby reducing the development cost and time by capturing the knowledge of experts in models.

abstract="The IEEE 802.15.4e standard was published in 2012 as an amendment to the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol defined by the IEEE 802.15.4-2011 standard. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the Timeslotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE 802.15.4e in the context of IoT (Internet of Things) regarding environment and changes in application requirements. A simulation scenario of a typical domestic sensor network is designed to evaluate the TSCH mode in a dynamic environment with the presence of WiFi devices. Also are explored the upper and lower bounds in performance gain due to self-learning. The relatively recent release of such standard accounts for its lack of support in network simulators and this work implements the TSCH in the well known open-source network simulator ns-3. This work enables the preview analysis of TSCH networks, decreasing necessary resources and therefore facilitating the use of such networks for social goods such as health monitoring, The results clearly show that the presence of WiFi signals greatly degrades the IEEE 802.15.4e network performance, in terms of throughput, delay and energy consumption. When applying self-learning techniques to avoid degraded channels, the network can properly function and achieves better performance. Also, a significant decrease in delay is also achieved when adapting the slotframe size according to the number of active devices.",

In such a scenario, the architecture as well as the radio resource management (RRM) of next-to-come 5G systems needs to be enhanced in order to cope with the exponential growth of low-latency and low-energy MTC traffic. To this end, we propose a dynamic RRM policy which (i) exploits an heterogeneous networks (HetNets) deployment aiming to handle massive huge load of MTC devices and (ii) adopts a spectrum sharing approach tailored to improve the spectrum utilization in MTC environments. By comparing our proposal with current policies in literature, simulations conducted through the open-source Network Simulator 3 (NS-3) shown that our proposed use of spectrum sharing technique can efficiently improve the performance of MTC traffic in terms of spectral efficiency, power consumption, and fairness.",

This article examines requirements that the digital society places on CS education. In our analysis, we identified numerous contexts, activities and knowledge areas relevant for students to cope with challenges of the digital world. Combined with content knowledge relevant in this domain, suitable phenomena and thus anchor points for teaching can be generated and, on this basis, specific learning scenarios can be developed that also consider general educative aims imposed by our society.",

abstract="Transportation systems are complex with respect to technology and operations with involvement in a wide range of human actors, organisations and technical solutions. For the operations and control of such complex environments, a viable solution is to apply intelligent computerised systems, such as computerised traffic control systems for coordinating airline transportation, or advanced monitoring and diagnostic systems in vehicles. Moreover, transportation assets cannot compromise the safety of the passengers by applying operation and maintenance activities. Indeed safety becomes a more difficult goal to achieve using traditional maintenance strategies and computerised solutions come into the picture as the only option to deal with complex systems interacting among them trying to balance the growth in technical complexity together with stable and acceptable dependability indexes. Industry 4.0 is a term that describes the fourth generation of industrial activity which is enabled by smart systems and Internet-based solutions. Two of the characteristic features of Industry 4.0 are computerization by utilising cyber-physical systems and intelligent factories that are based on the concept of ``internet of things''. Maintenance is one of the application areas, referred to as maintenance 4.0, in form of self-learning and smart systems that predicts failure, makes diagnosis and triggers maintenance by making use of ``internet of things''. This paper discusses the possibilities that lie within applying the maintenance 4.0 concept in the railway transportation industry and the positive effects on technology, organisation and operations from a systems perspective.",

abstract="While the vision of Internet of Things (IoT) is rather inspiring, its practical implementation remains challenging. Conventional programming approaches prove unsuitable to provide IoT resource constrained devices with the distributed processing capabilities required to implement intelligent, autonomic, and self-organizing behaviors. InÂ our previous work, we had already proposed an alternative programming methodology for such systems that is characterized by high-level programming and symbolic expressions evaluation, and developed a lightweight middleware to support it. Our approach allows for interactive programming of deployed nodes, and it is based on the simple but effective paradigm of executable code exchange among nodes. In this paper, we show how our methodology can be used to provide IoT resource constrained devices with reasoning abilities by implementing a Fuzzy Logic symbolic extension on deployed nodes at runtime.",

abstract="The main naming system in the Internet today, DNS, is based on globally unique, hierarchically structured domain names. It does not match the names people use in everyday life. This should change in the Future Internet, if it is to live up to its promise of seamless integration into people's everyday lives. Based on this observation, we propose to develop a new, intuitive naming system. This system allows human users to identify people, applications and content that they want to interact with in a completely intuitive manner. The intuitive naming system is based on two new functions, context collection and contextual analysis, placed in a new layer on top of the existing Internet naming layers. It is our belief that an intuitive naming system is a new concept that would substantially enhance the value of the Future Internet. It therefore deserves further analysis and development by European researchers.",

Despite many efforts have been made to improve searching methods (SM) they remain mostly limited to semantic elaboration of keywords. This implies that the SM are not capable of supporting the research of products that best satisfy customers, according to their characteristics and background. To overcome this limitation, this paper introduces an approach able to define a new ontological model that formalizes the knowledge necessary to implement a search engine capable to guide the customer to search the desired product or service according to his/her characteristics and needs. To this purpose, three essential aspects have been considered: a User Ontology (UO), a Product Ontology (PO) and rules (or properties) to link the user and product ontologies. The described approach is applied, as an example, to the products class known as Smart Objects that are part of the Internet of Things (IoT) market.",

abstract="Recently there has been an increase of interest in implementing a new set of home appliances, known as Smart Appliances that integrate Information Technologies, the Internet of Things and the ability of communicating with other devices. While Smart Appliances are characterized as an important milestone on the path to the Smart Grid, by being able to automatically schedule their loads according to a tariff or reflecting the power that is generated using renewable sources, there is not a clear understanding on the impact that the behavior of such devices will have in the comfort levels of users, when they shift their working periods to earlier, or later than, a preset time. Given these considerations, in this work we analyse the results of an assessment survey carried out to a group of Home Appliance users regarding their habits when dealing with these machines and the subjective impact in quality caused by either finishing its programs before or after the time limit set by the user. The results of this work are expected to be used as input for the evaluation of load scheduling algorithms running in energy management systems.",

However, few models have been proposed to trace the energy behavior of city districts and handle related data. In this article, we introduce DIMCloud, a model for heterogeneous data management and integration at district level, in a pervasive computing context. Our model, by means of an ontology, is able to register the relationships between different data sources of the district and to disclose the sources locations using a publish-subscribe design pattern. Furthermore, data sources are published as Web Services, abstracting the underlying hardware from the user's point-of-view.",

abstract="As Internet of Things (IoT) applications have taken the center stage of the technology development recently, the security issues and concerns arise naturally and significantly due to IoT connection to the anonymous and untrusted internet. Although the security protocols and technology for the internet applications have been studied for decades, the ubiquity and heterogeneity of IoT applications present unique challenges in handling security issues and problems. In addition to developing new protocols or to upgrade the existing protocols, some research has been done in experimenting security approaches for IoT applications. Since the results of the current research are mainly based on either the related protocols or the applicable approaches, the results of the discussion is often limited to a particular environment or a specific situation. In this paper, based on a thorough study on the existing research accomplishment and published experiment results, an integrated framework is proposed for evaluating the security solutions for IP-based IoT applications with the considerations in hardware constraints, operational constraints and network scenarios. The results of the study shows the potentials in drawing a balanced view in evaluating the security solutions to IP-based IoT applications and laying a step-stone for the further standardization of related IoT protocols and approaches for the security issues.",

The software system follows the idea of trading systems that offers efficient prediction with a high level of security. This concept is based on a particular implementation of finite state-machine algorithms, which enable physicians to run complex rules against particular health information of a certain patient to predict the evolution of the current diseases or the appearance of others.

abstract="The implementation of concepts such as smart cities, ambient intelligence and internet of things enables the construction of complex systems that may follow users across environments through many devices. One potential application is the assessment and assurance of well-being of users within different environment with different configurations. This is a complex task that requires the capture of the state and context of both users and environments through sensors dispersed across environments and users. It's the opportunities created by the emergence of technology that provide enough information to intelligent autonomous systems. Adapting expectations of a well-being assessment system to task and context is possible using the new techniques imported from different fields such as sensor networks, sensor fusion and machine learning. This article encompasses the design and implementation of a platform to evaluate well-being according to each context and translate it to sustainable indicators.",

abstract="The number of home devices integrating new technologies is continuously increasing. These advances allow us to improve our daily routines. In addition, the improvement in network infrastructure and the development of smart phones and mobile devices allow us access from any place to any of our systems over the Internet. Bearing in mind this idea, we have developed a low-cost ad hoc protocol based on Bluetooth technology that allows us to control all our home appliances and monitor the power consumption of our homes. Our proposal is based on an Android application installed on a mobile device which acts as server. The application allows users to program the various appliances. It is also able to check the status of the appliance, as well as controlling the power consumption of the house and its cost. The system is equipped with a smart algorithm able to manage all appliances and decide which ones should work as a function of various criteria such as time of day or power consumption. Finally, the system is able to detect faults in water and electricity supply for acting accordingly. All data received and sent by the server are stored in a database which the system can check and compare to make their own decisions.",

Currently the ability to supply the industry with engineering graduates and staff that have an up-to-date and relevant competences might be considered as a challenge for the society. In this paper an education approach is presented where academia - industry - research institutes cooperate around the development and implementation of master level courses. The methods applied to reach the educational goals, concerning expert competence within remote diagnostics, have been on site and remote lectures given by engineering, medical and metrology experts. The pedagogical approach utilized has been flipped classroom. The main results show that academic courses developed in cooperation with industry requires flexibility, time and effort from the involved partners. The evaluation interviews indicate that student are satisfied with the courses and pedagogical approach but suggests more reconciliation meetings for course development. Labs early in the course was considered good, and division of labs at the system and the component level. However further long-term studies of evaluation of impact is necessary.",

Service-orientation is expected to play a key role as enabling technology that allows the provisioning of hard- and software entities and contents as services. The dynamic composition of such services will enable the creation of service-oriented systems in the Future Internet (FI Apps), which will be increasingly provided by third parties. Together with increased expectations from end-users for personalization and customization, FI Apps will thus face an unprecedented level of change and dynamism. Based on our understanding of adaptive service-oriented systems, this paper discusses the key adaptation characteristics for FI Apps (illustrated by a concrete application domain). The importance of each of those characteristics has been empirically assessed by means of a survey study.

abstract="The increasing ageing population worldwide imposes some new challenges to the society like the provision of dependable support while facing a shortage in the numbers of caregivers, increased health costs and the emergence of new diseases. As such there is a great demand for technologies that support the independent and safe living of the elderly and ensuring that they are not socially isolated. Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) technologies have thus emerged to support the elderly people in their daily activities, while removing the need of caregivers being always physically present in order to look after the elderly. The current AAL systems are intelligent enough to take critical decisions in emergency situations like a fall, fire or a cardiac arrest, hence the elderly can live safely and independently. In this abstract, we describe our solution that aims at integrating all relevant functionalities of an AAL system, based on feedback collected from representative users. This work is carried out in the European Union project called CAMI (Artificially intelligent ecosystem for self-management and sustainable quality of life in AAL).",

abstract="Security, privacy and usability are vital quality attributes of IT systems and services. Users and legal authorities demand that systems are secure and preserve privacy. At the same time, security and privacy mechanisms should not complicate workflows and must be transparent for the user. In order to master this challenge, a close involvement of the users is necessary---both at development and at run-time. In this paper, we present a user-centered model for usable security and privacy that is aligned with user-centered design guidelines [34] and the Human-Centered Design process [28]. Based on this model, we present an initial method for the design of usable security systems. Through active involvement of the user, the model and the method are meant to help developers to identify and solve shortcomings of their security and privacy mechanisms. We motivate our work and present our results based on an Internet of Things/smart home scenario. Due to the amount of private data and strong data protection laws, both usability and privacy are of major importance in this domain. However, our model and method are not limited to the smart home domain, but can be applied whenever usable security and privacy are of particular interest for a system under development.",

abstract="Ambient-assisted living (AAL) is an initiative to extend the time the elderly can live in their home environment by increasing their autonomy and assisting them carry out their daily activities. AAL systems exploit information and communication technologies (ICT) in the assistance to carry out daily activities, health and activity monitoring, enhancing safety and security and getting access to social, medical and emergency systems. These ICTs are in the form of smart systems, which are physical objects that are augmented with sensing, processing and network capabilities, enabling them not only to intercommunicate with one another, but also to exchange information with people and react to their environment. This paper is on a low-cost technology customised to the South African environment to support ambient assisted living. The technology takes advantage of South Africa's digitalisation programme to provide broadband access in the support of AAL. Digital television as a gateway to internet access, wireless mesh networks for communication, motes for machine to machine communication and smart phones are the technologies supported in this architecture. A survey of AAL technologies was conducted and features of these systems that would be useful in defining our architecture identified. These features contribute to the development of an architecture for AAL. This research feeds into extending the body of knowledge on AAL technologies.",

abstract="The ``Internet of Things'' (IoT) has come to describe a new paradigm that enables the Internet to reach out into the real world of physical objects. Technologies like RFID, short-range wireless communication, real-time localization and sensor networks are becoming increasingly common and turning IoT into reality. It is expected to grow rapidly into a huge new market domain that may lead to disruptive changes in areas such as logistics, energy management and healthcare. Mobile and collaborative applications and services utilizing information processing and process support enabled by sensor data from a vast numbers of connected and cheap devices will change many markets when being made more easily available. New event-driven architectures (EDA) providing varied information to support collaborative decision-making enable more decisions to be made closer to the problem owner. The expected impacts of the combination of IoT and EDA on business and society are formidable. It also opens the possibility to take into account additional input from users to ensure shorter turnaround from ideas to new, personalized information systems support. Future business information systems will need to take this situation into account, addressing technological, methodological and conceptual challenges.

abstract="Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs), an advancing technology in the field of pervasive healthcare monitor patients ubiquitously and provide real-time feedback. Data communication consumes more energy than data processing in WBANs. As it is nearly impractical to replace or recharge the dead sensor nodes, it has become a major concern to overcome issues related to data communication in WBANs that affect network lifetime and energy consumption. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm for cluster head selection using genetic heuristics for enhancing network lifetime and harnessing energy consumption of the sensor nodes. It uses genetic heuristics and divides the network into clusters. A cluster head is chosen for inter and intra-cluster communication. Clustering is a feasible solution as it reduces the number of direct transmissions from source to sink. It enhances network lifetime and reduces energy consumption as there is inverse relationship between the two, i.e, less the energy consumption more is the network lifetime. The proposed algorithm is also analyzed mathematically in terms of time complexity, overhead and fault tolerance which reveals that our algorithm outperforms the existing techniques such as AnyBody and HIT in terms of energy efficiency and network lifetime.",

Aging causes a consequent psycho-physical decline which in many cases requires specific care and precautions by relatives. However, as can be easily inferable from the percentage of elderly just shown, today the national health-care systems are not able to manage and take charge of all these elders. More and more seniors are choosing to live alone, with all the problems related to emergencies and urgencies cases that can occur due to poor health status related to aging (falls, cardiovascular events, neurological events). In this case, providing health-care initiates to have its new challenges. One of the worst possible case of emergency in elderly living alone is bad injury within the home without the possibility for seeking a help. This paper presents a work related to this issue; project SMARTA, focused on biomedical and environmental monitoring for the active aging. The project is based on the use of biomedical sensors and sensorized garments for health status and cardio-monitoring, and accelerometers fixed on the floor for activity and fall detection. All this sensors are integrated in a system that is used for monitoring elderly both indoor and outdoor during their daily life thanks also to the connection over the Internet.",

Various health problems have been attributed to either fall or lack of sleep in the context of elderly people. Falling and sleep problems on a long term basis could eventually lead to sharp deteriorate in health, poor state of health and high cost for covering their health care. In this paper a new accurate and convenient while cost-efficient implementation of a monitoring system is presented. The use of an accelerometer based system was utilized in this work. The targeted device fit for this implementation is a smart watch. The algorithm of both the fall detector and sleep monitor presented in this work have been implemented and tested on multiple subjects. It also includes a database backend which is used to save the information collected from the system for further analysis and can provide healthcare professional with more insight of the person's life and can help more on further health medication being given to the person.",

abstract="Energy engineering study in the field of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) attracted many researchers in the last decade. The growing interest of researchers has contributed a variety of energy optimization solutions in the field for WSN. There is a need for consolidating all these energy efficiency initiatives at hardware, software, protocol level and algorithmic and architectural corrections and publish them as services for the energy management. The challenge is how this independent energy management framework helps in monitoring, optimizing and coordinating with the energy harvesting units of a typical WSN application bed set up and facilitate the entire energy management. One step further, can the energy management framework, keep track of benchmarks of energy usage for a typical WSN profile and help in recording the operating cost of the WSN application bed in terms of energy is the quest behind this framework Aatral. The independent energy framework Aatral helps not only managing the energy auditing, optimization, harvesting associated with the Wireless Sensor Network but also keeps track of the operating cost, cost estimations and helps in deciding the investments by its special module called Energy Economics Calculator.

At the clinical site, dedicated devices such as Slit-lamp Microscopy or Meniscometer have been used to quantify tear volume by ophthalmologist. However, these devices have access only in medical office and therefore have limited availability for the public. Tear volume changes with environmental, physical or psychological situation. For that reason, measurement of tear volume regardless of location, time or circumstances can be beneficial not only for healthcare professionals but also for patients. If tear volume could be measured by using smartphone, it is expected that the smartphone could be utilized as an IoT sensor for the healthcare application.

abstract="Enabling integration of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) and smart objects with the Internet is an important milestone towards the so called Internet of Things. Providing these networks with QoS capabilities is crucial for emerging applications that have end-to-end requirements on the border wireless network domain. Impairments such as delays and losses are heavily influenced by the quality of the communication channels, the routing, the MAC protocol and the interactions of these influential factors. In this work we report on a hierarchical routing scheme for sensor networks with multi-channel radios aiming at improving QoS. The scheme decouples the aforementioned influences: The MAC-protocol is responsible for a scheduling in a set of nodes called a cluster. Neighboring clusters use different frequencies. The routing is done at the level of clusters. The (distributed) algorithms executed by the network nodes to support this architecture are evaluated against optimal solutions for clustering, frequency allocation and routing derived from Integer Linear Programming.",

This is known as Internet of things (IoT). Scalability of the entire system increases in case of more devices in IoT system. So in IoT system, main challenges are to maintain scalability and throughput. To meet these challenges, various architectures are used for implementing IoT applications such as SOAP-based, RESTful, broker-based SOA architecture. While service-oriented architecture provides system integration, interoperability, business agility. Though service-oriented architecture is mainly used for implementing various IoT applications, it faces some challenges such as security, interoperability, and context awareness. Event-driven service-oriented architecture (EDSOA) is a new architectural style which is an extension of broker-based architecture and most suitable for IoT applications. In this paper, we have tried to cover all these architectures.",

abstract="The integration of pervasive computing and social computing results in a new emerging research field - Socially Aware Computing. This new paradigm makes it possible to study Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) as a social network, in which the embedded sensors are the main entities as opposed to human beings in a traditional social network. Therefore, the combination of WSN and Socially Aware Computing holds great promise and challenge to use the sensory data to understand human behavior, human mobility, and ultimately to help solve human social problems. In this paper, we propose an information interaction infrastructure in WSN based on Socially Aware Computing, in which the sensory context is used to recognize a broad range of complex human activities and environmental situations. We also present the information interaction challenges for WSN integrated into the Internet and point out the future work in this area.",

abstract="Recent innovative developments in ICT like Internet of Things, Cloud Computing and Big Data encourage further the design and application of ``Smart e-Government Systems and applications'' for citizens and business. These smart systems are aiming to further improve everyday lives, expand business frontiers, and facilitate the movement of citizens by reducing the constraints imposed by existing borders between Member States of a federation like in cases of the European Union, USA and Eurasian Economic Union. Furthermore, these systems provide the means to combat international terrorism, fraud and crime more effectively. They could also have a positive impact in many other areas such as Banking, Health, Justice, Forensic and Crime sectors of bilateral or global interrelations. Beyond the above important application areas, Smart e-Government Systems could have a considerable effect on the critically important areas of Life Sciences. Smart Cross-Border e-Government Systems will be characterized by their ability to be used by governmental organizations, citizens, business and any combination thereof independently of their location and nationality, in a cross border environment based on shared electronic authentication, identification and signature support services. Earlier on this year, common strategic policies and successfully implemented European Union projects have led to the availability of e-Authentication, e-Signature and e-Identification platforms. These latest technological advances dictate the redesign of existing and design of new Smart Cross-Border e-Government Services and Applications fully exploiting the ICT innovations.",

abstract="The present paper establishes foundations for implementing Privacy and Security by Design in the scope of the Internet of Things (IoT) by using a new paradigm namely the Privacy Verification Chains (PVC). PVCs will act as a ``privacy ledgers'' allowing participating entities to prove that they are entitled to hold privacy-related information, regardless of how this information is handled or stored. Furthermore, the PVC structure provides the two following benefits: In case of a security breach resulting in a user data leak, the affected company may browse all the relevant PVCs in order to identify the users affected and trigger the corresponding informative and corrective measures. The PVC will also provide support for bidirectional browsing which means that the data owner will be capable of browsing all the PVCs involving the data he owns in order to find out all the data processors that hold his personal information. From a wider perspective, we enforce a strict separation between data providers and data controllers, where providers are managers of their data privacy, and controllers are accountable for the privacy and protection of the data provided. This role separation will be ensured by a data controller of a so-called Smart Data System (SDS). The SDS handles information along with its privacy settings (metadata), defined by the data owner. In order to control this privacy-preserving framework, our system introduces a Forensic and Auditing System that will enforce the data protection from the processor to a third party. This component will also provide a comprehensive logging functionality that will constitute a legally-binding support to respond to audit procedures, police investigations and(or) law enforcement obligations.",

abstract="Starting from the evolution of Internet, this paper addresses the concept of pervasive computing whose aim is to create a pervasive network of heterogeneous devices which communicate data with each other and with other networking devices in a seamless way through heterogeneous network portions. This operative framework is also called Future Internet. Extending the idea of pervasive computing to interplanetary and other challenging links implies adding to the classical problems of pervasive communications such as quality of service, mobility and security, peculiarities such as intermittent connectivity, disruptive links, large and variable delays, and high bit error rates which are currently tackled through the paradigm of Delay and Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTNs). Satellite systems used to connect isolated and rural areas have already to cope with a series of challenges that are magnified in space communications characterized by huge distances among network nodes. At the same time, a space communication system must be reliable over time and the importance of enabling Internet-like communications with space vehicles (as well as with rural areas) is increasing, making the concept of extended Future Internet of practical importance. This paper will discuss this challenging issue.",

We also present the idea of how to partly transfer such approach to the determination of the driving style, as aggressive driving is one of the causes of car accidents. For determination of the driving style a variety of methods are used including the preparation movements before maneuvers, identification of steering wheel angle, accelerator and brake pedal pressures, glance locations, facial expressions, speed, medical examinations before driving as well as filling out of the questionnaires after the journey. In our paper we present a methodology for estimation of potentially unsafe driving (in the meaning of more intensive acceleration and braking compared to average driving) and discuss how to estimate such unsafe driving before it actually takes place. We present sensors and data which can be used for these purposes. Such data include heart rate variability from chest belt sensor, behavioral and contextual data from smartphone, STAI short questionnaire to assess personal anxiety and anxiety as a state at certain moment, and initial interaction with car during opening and closing of the car doors. To determine intensive acceleration and braking we analyzed GPS data like speed, acceleration and also data from accelerometer inside the car to avoid interference in GPS-signal. Actually, our long term goals are to provide feedback about potentially unsafe driving in advance and thus strengthening driver's attention on the driving process before the start.",

abstract="Software-intensive product companies are becoming increasingly data-driven as can be witnessed by the big data and Internet of Things trends. However, optimally prioritizing customer needs in a mass-market context is notoriously difficult. While most companies use product owners or managers to represent the customer, research shows that the prioritization made is far from optimal. In earlier research, we have coined the term `the open loop problem' to characterize this challenge. For instance, research shows that up to half of all the features in products are never used. This paper presents a conceptual model that emphasizes the need for combining qualitative feedback in early stages of development with quantitative customer observation in later stages of development. Our model is inductively derived from an 18 months close collaboration with six large global software-intensive companies.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) emerged as a paradigm in which smart things collaborate among them and with other physical and virtual objects using the Internet in order to perform high level tasks. These things appear in a variety of application domains, including smart grid, health care and smart spaces where several parties share data in order to tackle specific tasks. Data in such domains are rich in sensitive data and data owner-specific habits. Thus, IoT raises concerns about privacy and data protection. This paper reports on a systematic literature review of privacy preserving solutions used in Cooperative Information Systems (CIS) in the IoT field. To do so, and after retrieving scientific productions on the subject, we classify the results according to several facets. In this paper, we consider a subset of them: (i) data life cycle, (ii) privacy preserving techniques and (iii) ISO privacy principles. We combine the facets then express and analyze the results as bubble charts. We analyze the proposed solutions in terms of the techniques they deployed and the privacy principles they covered according to the ISO standard and the data privacy laws and regulations of the European Commission on the Protection of Personal Data. Finally, we identifies recommendations to involve privacy principle coverage and security requirement fulfillment in the IoT applications.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) architecture primarily consists of massive amounts of heterogeneous objects, equipped with sensing, computing, and communication capabilities to continuously sense the smart cities pulse. The coordinated collection of this data produces relevant scalability and management issues not only in terms of communication but also in storage and computing to process and analyze large amounts of incoming big data streams. In these systems, people also play a pivotal role which includes both social and technical issues, making the design of these solutions a very complex task. This paper overviews the prevalent solutions and architecture design principles in IoT-big data ecosystems for smart cities sensing. Furthermore, we present the needs of IoT-big data software ecosystems by exemplifying existing IoT systems. We also provide useful insights towards future innovation to address open issues and challenges that are identified based on the expected growth of data in the next decade.",

abstract="We present a method for computing the best provisioning of security resources for Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios characterized by a high degree of mobility. The security infrastructure is specified by a security resource allocation plan computed as the solution of an optimization problem that minimizes the risk of having IoT devices not monitored by any resource. Due the mobile nature of IoT devices, a probabilistic framework for modeling such scenarios is adopted. We adapt the concept of shortfall from economics as a risk measure and show how to compute and evaluate the quality of an allocation plan. The proposed approach fits well with applications such as vehicular networks, mobile ad-hoc networks, smart cities, or any IoT environment characterized by mobile devices that needs a monitoring infrastructure.",

abstract="Many security challenges have emerged from what is defined as Internet of Things (IoT), due to the inherent permanent connection of devices involved in networks. Furthermore, IoT devices are often deployed in unattended working environment and, hence, they are prone to physical attacks. Attackers take advantages of such weaknesses to clone devices, tamper the software installed on them and extract cryptographic keys. In this paper, we propose a technique to exploit Static Random Access Memory based Phisical Unclonable Functions to have available a chain-oftrust on a microcontroller device. We prove its effectiveness in terms of reliability and required overhead by introducing a case study based on the STM32F7 device running the Linux operating system.",

abstract="The rise of smart buildings, i.e. buildings equipped with latest technology and built according to cutting-edge architectural advances, implies increased buildings' complexity. For this reason, both new and retrofitted buildings are often susceptible to new and unforeseen faults, whose timely detection and servicing can significantly affect buildings performance. Many Fault Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) methods are data-driven, where the quality of collected data can significantly affect the accuracy of results. However, data collection for FDD of buildings is a challenging task as needed data is not typically readily available. In this paper we focus on the data collection for FDD of smart buildings. This forms the motivation of this paper, i.e. to identify the challenges that relate to data collection processes for FDD of buildings, as well as propose workarounds of how to tackle the more important ones. Furthermore, we also look into how new technologies can be useful for this goal.",

Many children with autism are highly interested and motivated by smart devices such as computers and touch screen tablets. These types of assistive technology devices get children with autism to interact, make choices, respond, and tell parents what they want, need, think, and maybe even feel. Out framework uses JXTA-Overlay platform and smartbox device to monitor the children and create P2P communication between children, parents and therapists. Various visual systems, such as objects, photographs, realistic drawings, line drawings, and written words, can be used with assorted modes of technology, as long as the child can readily comprehend the visual representation. Vocabulary skills such as names of common everyday objects, fruits, animals, toys, names of familiar people can be taught through our proposed framework.",

Trueness of this hypothesis would imply that, instead of measuring a patient's BP in an invasive way, this could be indirectly measured by applying a wearable PPG sensor and by using the results of a regression analysis linking PPG and BP. Genetic Programming (GP) is well suited to find the relationship between PPG and BP, because it automatically evolves the structure of the most suitable explicit mathematical model for a regression task. In this paper, for the first time, some preliminary experiments on the use of GP to explicitly relate PPG and BP values have been performed. For both systolic and diastolic BP values, explicit nonlinear mathematical models have been achieved, involving an approximation error of less than 3Â mmHg in both cases.",

abstract="The Childhood protection is a subject with high value for the society, but, the Child Abuse cases are difficult to identify. The process from suspicious to accusation is very difficult to achieve. It must configure very strong evidences. Typically, Health Care services deal with these cases from the beginning where there are evidences based on the diagnosis, but they aren't enough to promote the accusation. Besides that, this subject it's highly sensitive because there are legal aspects to deal with such as: the patient privacy, paternity issues, medical confidentiality, among others. We propose a Child Abuses critical knowledge monitor system model that addresses this problem. This decision support system is implemented with a multiple scientific domains: to capture of tokens from clinical documents from multiple sources; a topic model approach to identify the topics of the documents; knowledge management through the use of ontologies to support the critical knowledge sensibility concepts and relations such as: symptoms, behaviors, among other evidences in order to match with the topics inferred from the clinical documents and then alert and log when clinical evidences are present. Based on these alerts clinical personnel could analyze the situation and take the appropriate procedures.",

For this purpose, a charge plasma based dielectrically modulated TFET is proposed in this work, where source region is having SiGe material (with Si and Ge composition equal to 0.5) to improve the ON-state current. The charge plasma concept is employed to make the fabrication process simpler and to avoid the random dopant fluctuations (RDFs) and higher thermal budget. The significant improvement in the sensitivity of the proposed dielectrically modulated junctionless (DMJL) TFET biosensor with different dielectric constant and charge density, and a comparison with conventional MOSFET-based sensor enables its potential application for the Health-IoT applications.",

Several studies indicated the need to minimize the process of hospitalization and the effects related to the high cost of patient care. In this context, a promising trend in healthcare is to move medical checks routines from a hospital (hospital-centric) to the patient's home (home-centric), but to make it possible we need Internet of Things (IoT)-based technologies and platforms to enable remote health monitoring. The application of IoT in healthcare area is a common hope because it will allow hospitals to operate more efficiently and patients to receive better treatment. With the use of IoT-based healthcare applications, there is an unprecedented opportunity to improve the quality and efficiency of the medical treatment and consequently improve patients' wellness, as well as a better application of the government's financial resources. Thus, based on this context, this paper aims to propose an IoT-based healthcare platform for the remote monitoring of patients in critical condition.

A polycarbonate film covered with organic molecular semiconductor was used as the temperature measurement element. To minimize the electrical response of the developed bi layer thermistor to deformations, the thermistor was attached to a rigid film-like platform specifically fabricated in the textile by its local melting. Our study shows that the developed platform enables engineering of the conductive fabric the electrical resistance of which exclusively responded to temperature changes. Such e-textiles may be easily prepared using a simple fabrication procedure and, therefore, they are compatible with conductive sensing fabrics prepared by printing techniques. The developed organic thermistor, being cheap, lightweight and biocompatible, is highly attractive for applications in wearable biomedical technology.",

abstract="Key-establishment based on parameters of the communication channels is a highly attractive option for many applications that operate in a dynamic mobile environment with peer-to-peer association. So far, high usability and dynamic key management with the capability of perfect forward secrecy are very difficult to achieve for wireless devices which have to operate under strict resource constraints. Additionally, previous work has failed to address hybrid systems composed of physical layer security (PHYSEC) and asymmetric cryptography for key establishment. In this work we present the first hybrid system architecture suitable for resource-constrained platforms. As a result, long term deployment due to key diversity and forward/backward secrecy can be achieved while still satisfying the tight timing of an initial setup imposed by high user acceptance. Our design strongly focuses on reusing communication chip components for PHYSEC and makes use of efficient asymmetric cryptography (e.g., ECDH) augmented by physical layer security. Our prototype implementation demonstrates that our approach has the potential to dramatically reduce the cost of securing small embedded devices for the Internet of Things, and hence make mass production and deployment viable.",

However, most of the measurements methods are connection based, i.e. sensors are connected to the body which is often complicated and requires personal assistance. This paper proposed a simple, low-cost and non-contact approach for measuring multiple physiological parameters using a web camera in real time. Here, the heart rate and respiration rate are obtained through facial skin colour variation caused by body blood circulation. Three different signal processing methods such as Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), independent component analysis (ICA) and Principal component analysis (PCA) have been applied on the colour channels in video recordings and the blood volume pulse (BVP) is extracted from the facial regions. HR, IBI and RR are subsequently quantified and compared to corresponding reference measurements. High degrees of agreement are achieved between the measurements across all physiological parameters. This technology has significant potential for advancing personal health care and telemedicine.",

abstract="The healthcare sector faces important challenges in evaluating and improving its services to meet desired targets, patient needs, and government requirements. In particular, the introduction of a new process or information system in healthcare is a challenging task, especially in the absence of mature practices for requirements engineering and process modeling. Most of today's healthcare process research is focused on mappings between existing processes and new ones without considering the different needs of multiple stakeholders and the satisfaction of organizational goals. In this paper, we introduce a novel Activity-based Process Integration (AbPI) approach that highlights integration opportunities of each new activity into current processes. AbPI exploits the User Requirements Notation (URN) language to model, analyze, and estimate the potential impact of each integration opportunity on performance objectives, organizational goals, and stakeholder satisfaction. We demonstrate the capabilities of the proposed approach with an illustrative example (increasing patient satisfaction in an Emergency Room). Preliminary results show the feasibility of the approach as well as many potential benefits over existing approaches.",

abstract="Pervasive computing environments and technologies have attracted much attention in the health-care field recently. The application of pervasive computing technologies in the public health and medicine caused the emergence of pervasive healthcare as a new concept. Using pervasive healthcare, patients are able to access to the health and medical services at anytime and anywhere. However selecting the most trusted service provider among available ones is a challenging task. In this paper, we have proposed a new model for pervasive health-care systems in which the patient smart device not only uses its own past experiences but also learns from its neighbors (friends) in a health-care social network to update the trust of available providers using a CLA (cellular learning automata). Comparing the proposed method with existing recommendation based methods shows that it is more scalable, efficient and appropriate for dynamic environments without sacrificing the precision.",

abstract="Over the latest years many commercial Real-Time Tracking management systems (RTMS) were introduced into the market. The solutions started to be designed for single tracking purposes, but vendors soon realized that valuable tracking benefits would result by the appropriate design of a service layer. From the many RTMS solutions currently on market, it was not found a specific or suitable solution for general Law Enforcement Agencies (LEAs). A list of requirements was gathered from one of the Portuguese LEAs, GNR (Guarda Nacional Republicana) to fully understand the generic daily challenges. Main requirements raised by GNR strive with that address issues like cost, data exchange security, bi-directional communication services, performance, network fault tolerance and user-friendly interfaces. This paper presents a RTMS solution and a service layer specifically conceived for LEAs. It will be shown that learning over risk assessment mappings may bring additional benefits to LEAs. Experimental tests were performed to quantitatively measure the solution behavior.",

FESTIVAL EU-Japan collaborative project aims at federating these testbeds, making them interoperable, allowing centralized data collection and analyzing societal issues in both cultures, all of it under a user privacy-preserving context. In this sense, FESTIVAL pursues a twofold approach: firstly, the intercontinental federation of testbeds in Japan and Europe using existing tools as well as developing new ones; and secondly, the creation of new services and experiments, to be performed on top of the FESTIVAL testbeds and experimentation facilities, associated to three different smart city domains: smart energy, smart building and smart shopping. Throughout this article the current status of the project (in its first year) is shown, describing the Experimentation as a Service federation approach to be implemented, with a first analysis of the platforms and testbeds that are included within the project. Furthermore, the paper also describes the services and use cases that will be conducted within FESTIVAL lifespan. Finally, next steps to be carried out in the coming years of the project are indicated.",

Their intrinsic resource limitations however constitute critical requirements, such as security, a great challenge. When these nodes are associated with applications that might have an impact in user's privacy or even become life threatening, the security issues are of primary concern. Access to these resources should be appropriately controlled to ensure that such wearable nodes are adequately protected. On the other hand, it is very important to not restrict access to only a very closed group of entities.

Unfortunately, the cloud computing paradigm is unable to meet the requirements of critical applications that require low latency or enhanced privacy levels. The deployment of private cloud services on top of pervasive grids represent an interesting alternative to traditional cloud infrastructures, allowing the use of near-environment resources for IoT data analysis tasks. In this work we discuss the challenges associated with the deployment of IoT services over pervasive environments, and present a study case deployed over CloudFIT, a computing middleware for pervasive systems. Hence, we evaluate the behavior of a data-intensive application under volatility and heterogeneity constraints, bringing to light to the use of low-end devices that are usually located at the proximity to IoT sensors/actuators.",

The goal of the project was to design, implement and demonstrate a secure WSN for the protection of critical infrastructure. In order to provide a reliable service, the system must detect any kind of tampering with the sensor nodes, prevent eavesdropping and manipulation of the communication as well as detect, track and classify intruders in the protected region. Therefore based on previous experiences, a real-world WSN was developed, which addresses practical issues like water proofing, energy consumption, sensor deployment and visualization of the WSN state, but also provides a unique security concept, a interesting combination of sensors and sophisticated sensor data processing and analysis. The system was evaluated by examining firstly the sensors and the sensor processing algorithms and then conducting realistic field test.",

abstract="Smart Cities have received a significant amount of attention in recent years. The East London Smart City Public Safety Project aims to use citizens as an information source in order to report qualitative data in a natural language format. In order for this approach to be successful, an appropriate means of motivating citizens to contribute their observations voluntarily is necessary, and thus the aim of this paper. Motivational factors are identified through a survey administered to participants who have reported public safety matters. The survey is based on the constructs of the Theory of Planned Behaviour, namely: Attitude Toward Participation, Subjective Norm and Perceived Behavioural Control. From this study, it emerges that attitude toward reporting public safety matters and societal pressures are the most relevant factors determining a citizen's motivation to report public safety matters.",

abstract="Recently major emphasis is exerted on development of effective tools and techniques for enriching IoT development environment. Typically an IoT application, for example a health monitoring application, not only requires domain knowledge of a programmer, but also similar knowledge from a medical practitioner, a sensor manufacturer, an infrastructure manager, etc. Such involvement of several experts makes the development process complex, resulting in escalation of time and cost of the effort. Model Driven Development (MDD) has been proposed as a development technique where such problem can be mitigated. This paper presents a system based on the MDD paradigm. As a part of the system, we present a work-flow designer framework, a visual drag and drop interface, where a developer can stitch various functional models recommended from a well-organized, annotated and crowd-sourced semantic repository of algorithms (from various domains), named as Algopedia, to quickly build a semantic workflow and in turn an end to end IoT application.",

abstract="The combination of high-performance and quality with cost-effective productivity, realizing reconfigurable, adaptive and evolving factories leading to sustainable manufacturing industries is one of the emerging research challenges in the domain of Internet of Things. So, it is important to define strategies and technical solutions to allow manufacturing process to autonomously react to the changing factors. Continuous data collection from heterogeneous sources and infusion of such data into suitable processes to enable almost real-time reactive systems is emerging research domain. This research work provides a technical framework for continuous data collection in support of the supply network and manufacturing assets optimization based on collaborative production planning. This research work explores its connection toÂ legacy systems, software components and hardware devices to provide information to the different data consumers. The most relevant achievement of this work is the framework to bridge differences among computing systems, devices and networks allowing uniformity for data access by application decoupling data consumers from data sources.",

abstract="Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSAN), composed by small sensing nodes for acquisition, collection and analysis of data, are often employed for communication between Internet objects. However the WSAN have some problems such as sensors' energetic consumption and CPU load. The massive storage capacity, large processing speeds and the rapid elasticity makes Cloud Computing a very good solution to these problems. To efficiently manage devices' resources, and achieve efficient communication with various platforms (cloud, mobile), this paper proposes a middleware that allows flows of AI applications' execution to be transferred between a device and the cloud.",

Growing smartphone users, increased sensing capabilities provided by smart phones, and the ability to share that data over the internet, presents an opportunity to build a mobile application that can provide an insight into mobility information through passive sensing. We have developed a mobile application to bridge the information gap by passively tracking tourist location and improvising tourist services using mobile crowd-sensing. Capabilities to cluster location data to form places of interest have been particularly focused in this paper.

abstract="After the fall of former political regime in Slovakia in 1989, Bratislava has undergone many dynamic developing changes that were not too positively influenced the appearance and functions of the city. Spontaneous and unsystematic development in this period seems to continue even after 25 years. Conversely, a significant decline is becoming increasingly marked in the urban infrastructure, of which insufficient attention is paid. This is because infrastructure for developers is often only enforced expenditure and the city does not have sufficient financial resources to meet requirements on its renewal. Moreover, the infrastructure requirements from before 30 years are now heavily modified and it is currently inadequate and capacity insufficient. Here we can mention for example a significant parking problems in many parts of Bratislava mainly caused by the substantial increase in the level of motorization to the period when the present transportation infrastructure was planned. Of course, in Bratislava there are also some positive examples, to which the authors of this paper focuses, that are currently considered significant by the fact that towards the Bratislava closer to the concept of Smart City. In these selected examples it is also important the implementation of existing ICT technologies that form an integral part of the modern Smart Cities.

abstract="Requirements of IPv6 over Low Power WPAN (6LoWPAN) are energy conservation and low protocol complexity. Incorporating the desirable features, potential-field-based routing known as ALFA (autonomous load-balancing field-based any cast routing) achieves autonomous load-balancing and efficient path-length provisioning with little control overhead in a wireless mesh network (WMN), which is a hub-and-spoke type network similarly to 6LoWPAN. In this paper, we provide the protocol architecture of ALFA for 6LoWPAN to consider energy consumption. Distinct from the case of ALFA in a WMN, when the energy level of a sensor node declines to a threshold, the exchange of its potential information holds and its energy shortage is reported to a sink node.",

Such application consists of the provision of sensors, which constantly receive signals on gases in the environment. Subsequently, the information is analyzed by a fuzzy system that determines when to generate alert notifications, identifying the times when levels are high, either by incendiary or high pollution situations.

Knowledge workers view Big Data as huge correlated data sets requiring super large computing powers to analyze the process and derive meaningful conclusions. Big Data is multidimensional data these days ranging from info-bytes from newspapers to online journals, from tweets to YouTube videos, social networking updates and blog discussions, which any business/organization is accumulating thru various information channels. The huge explosion of data and increase in Internet devices has led to the rapid rise of Big Data. Majority of data that contribute to Big Data comes from Internet sources or are Internet of Things. The scale of data set referred as ``Big Data can be defined as data that legacy DBMS tools can't load and understand the heterogeneous relationship.'' With the massive current technological advances the cutoff size of data sets qualifying as Big Data is bound to increase. We look at some of the underlying concepts of Big Data and propose solutions in Service Industry as there the quality of service is a key differentiator as compared traditional manufacturing industry where the quality of finished goods or product is important. The primary advantage of Big Data is by aggregating large amount of data integrated from various sources such as CRM, social media, email, web, mobile and tablet and data acquisition from other technologies. In this paper, we try to review the potential applications of Big Data in Service Industry and understand the source of its decision making data from Internet. We understand that the business is not interested in single data but desires to look at the trend and patterns in the data which might boost the business tremendously, and Internet of things would be creating streams of data needed for this purpose.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) applications by means of wireless sensor networks (WSN) produce large amounts of raw data. These data might formally be defined by following a semantic IoT model that covers data, meta-data, as well as their relations, or might simply be stored in a database without any formal specification. In both cases, using association rules as a data mining technique may result into inferring interesting relations between data and/or metadata. In this paper we argue that the context has not been used extensively for added value to the mining process. Therefore, we propose a different approach when it comes to association rule mining by enriching it with a context-aware ontology. The approach is demonstrated by hand of an application to WSNs for water quality monitoring. Initially, new ontology, its concepts and relationships are introduced to model water quality monitoring through mobile sensors. Consequently, the ontology is populated with quality data generated by sensors, and enriched afterwards with context. Finally, the evaluation results of our approach of including context ontology in the mining process are promising: new association rules have been derived, providing thus new knowledge not inferable when applying association rule mining simply over raw data.",

Environmental hazards, high costs, complex planning processes, affordability, accessibility and safety are crucial factors. Also, the demographic change in line with increasing individual transportation needs and mobility profiles aggravate a sustainable and topical planning of urban mobility. As the understanding of human needs is vital for the acceptance of novel mobility concepts, we explored pro- and contra-using motives for public transportation as well as aspects of conditional acceptance. Using an empirical approach, 580 persons answered a questionnaire in this regard. The results allow insights into opinions of age and gender related mobility needs in the public transport sector.",

abstract="One of the most important challenges of this decade is the Internet of Things (IoT) that pursues the integration of real-world objects in Internet. One of the key areas of the IoT is the Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems, which should be able to react to variable and continuous changes while ensuring their acceptance and adoption by users. This means that AAL systems need to work as self-adaptive systems. The autonomy property inherent to software agents, makes them a suitable choice for developing self-adaptive systems. However, agents lack the mechanisms to deal with the variability present in the IoT domain with regard to devices and network technologies. To overcome this limitation we have already proposed a Software Product Line (SPL) process for the development of self-adaptive agents in the IoT. Here we analyze the challenges that poses the development of self-adaptive AAL systems based on agents. To do so, we focus on the domain and application engineering of the self-adaptation concern of our SPL process. In addition, we provide a validation of our development process for AAL systems.",

abstract="Smart mobile phones are vital to the Mobile Cloud Computing (MCC) paradigm where compute jobs can be offloaded to the devices from the Cloud and vice-versa, or the devices can act as peers to collaboratively perform a task. Recent research in IoT context also points to the use of smartphones as sensor gateways highlighting the importance of data processing at the network edge. In either case, when a smart phone is used as a compute resource or a sensor gateway, the corresponding tasks must be executed in addition to the user's normal activities on the device without affecting the user experience. In this paper, we propose a framework that can act as an enabler of such features by classifying the availability of system resources like CPU, memory, network usage based on applications running on an Android phone. We show that, such app-based classifications are user-specific and app usage varies with different handsets, leading to different classifications. We further show that irrespective of such variation in classification, distinct patterns exist for all users with available opportunity to schedule external tasks, without affecting user experience. Based on the next to-be-used applications, we output a predicted set of system resources. The resource levels along with handset architecture may be used to estimate worst case execution time for external jobs.",

The emergence of new concepts such as Internet of Things or Cloud Computing and technologies such as 5G resulting in an increasing processes automatization in the traffic system. In doing so, the unavailability of individual IC resource can result in negative user experience in usage of certain classes of services, but can also represent a potentially large security risk and compromised user safety.

In order to inspire similar advancements within the IoT community, this extended abstract discusses how this goal has been addressed by pioneering the concept of a self-learning robotic ecology within the EU project RUBICON (Robotic UBIquitous Cognitive Network); how such an approach relates to the concept of Affordances at the basis of Gibsons' theory of ecological psychology; and how it can be used to drive the gradual adaptation of a robotic ecology to changing contexts and evolving requirements.",

abstract="The emergence of new technologies such as IoT and Big Data, the change in the behavior of society in general and the younger generation in particular, require higher education institutions to ``look'' for teaching differently.

Thus, it is necessary to urgently begin a disruption of current teaching models, to be able to include in these processes the new technologies and the daily habits of the new generations. The early usage of mobile devices and the constant connection to the Internet (social networks, among others) mean that the current generation of young people, who are reaching higher education, has the most technological literacy ever.

abstract="A virtual patient navigator is a web/mobile application that helps patients with lung cancer diagnosis reduce their anxiety and uncertainties. In particular, lung cancer patients easily become overwhelmed when having to manage information overload, many appointments with different instructions and locations, and recommendations on how to improve their lifestyle. Existing solutions such as paper-based patient navigators provide much reliable information but are limited in terms of dynamic updates and do not provide opportunities for interactions between care providers and patients. In this paper, we propose a new web-based, mobile, and user-friendly virtual patient navigator application named Care Ami, which incorporates the information found in an existing paper-based navigator along with new features such as remote updates to personal care paths and calendars, personalized navigation guidance, sharing of symptom/medication information, and peer group support. The architecture and main features of this application are presented. Based on the identified requirements, Care Ami compares favorably against related work and solutions.",

abstract="This paper presents a case-based classification system for alcohol detection using physiological parameters. Here, four physiological parameters e.g. Heart Rate Variability (HRV), Respiration Rate (RR), Finger Temperature (FT), and Skin Conductance (SC) are used in a Case-based reasoning (CBR) system to detect alcoholic state. In this study, the participants are classified into two groups as drunk or sober. The experimental work shows that using the CBR classification approach the obtained accuracy for individual physiological parameters e.g., HRV is 85{\%}, RR is 81{\%}, FT is 95{\%} and SC is 86{\%}. On the other hand, the achieved accuracy is 88{\%} while combining the four parameters i.e., HRV, RR, FT and SC using the CBR system. So, the evaluation illustrates that the CBR system based on physiological sensor signal can classify alcohol state accurately when a person is under influence of at least 0.2Â g/l of alcohol.",

abstract="Â Recent data of the European Union reveals that the main chronic pathologies are the Cardiovascular Disease (CVD), the main cause of death in Europe, and respiratory diseases, specially the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). Each year CVD causes over 4 million deaths in Europe alone and over 1.9 million deaths in the European Union (EU). According to the WHO (World Health Organization), in 2030 COPD will be the third leading cause of death, and the first cause of sanitary costs in Europe, due to the profiles of the expenses in health sector and the long time expenses by age groups and their important associate morbidity. New medical applications based on remote monitoring can help treat those chronic diseases but significantly will increase the volume of health information to manage, including data from medical and biological sensors, being then necessary to process this huge volume of data using techniques from Big Data. In this paper we propose one potential solution for creating those new services, based on Big Data processing and IoT concepts.",

There are a lot of raw medical data available to healthcare organizations in the form of structured and unstructured datasets, but the need is to analyze this data to get information and to make intelligent decisions. By using data mining, classification tool on a real dataset of cardiac patients we propose a model which classified these patients into four major classes. This model will help to identify the risk of HF and patients who have no HF signs but structural irregularities. We can also identify the patients having HF signs and irregularities and those having the critical stage of HF. This paper provides a detailed summary of modern strategies for management and analysis of HF patients by classes (1 to 4) that have appeared in the past few years.",

The onset of electricity allowed more labour saving devices to be developed, again in the home and at work. These were typically `standalone' devices that needed localised control. In the 1940s industrial control systems were making their presence felt in industry. In 1978 the X10 protocol was patented and allowed remote control of electrical appliances.

abstract="Illicit Web content filtering is a content-based analysis technique, applied to censor inappropriate contents on the Internet. Web content filtering can recognize undesirable contents through the application of AI techniques, linguistic analysis, or machine learning to classify Web pages into a set of predefined categories. However, the capacity to distinguish between useful and harmful Web content remains a major research challenge, which usually leads to the problem of under-blocking and over-blocking. Further, the extraction of best term representation for classifier presents a major limitation due to curse of dimensionality, where a feature can have the same term frequency (TF) in two or more categories but has different semantic meanings such as illicit pornography and sex education context also known as ambiguous issues. Besides, the high dimensionality of features on a Web page, even for moderate size, it has made the term representation value for classifier more complex, which affects the performance of classification. Thus, this research proposes a modified term weighting scheme (TWS) for narrative and discrete Web in order to increase the classification performance. Characteristics of pornography Web site were extracted and significant characteristics were identified and mapped against term weighting factors. Initial result revealed that other criteria such as rare feature have potential to be regarded as significant criteria in TWS technique to distinguish high-similarity Web content.",

abstract="Stroke is one of the major problems in medical and healthcare that can cause severe disability and death of patients especially for older population. Rehabilitation plays an important role in stroke therapy. However, most of the rehabilitative exercises are monotonous and tiring for the patients. For a particular time, they can easily get bored in doing these exercises. The role of patient's motivation in rehabilitation is vital. Motivation and rehabilitative outcomes are strongly related. Digital games are promising to help stroke patients to feel motivated and more engaged in rehabilitative training through motivational gameplay. Most of the commercial games available in the market are not well-designed for stroke patients and their motivational needs in rehabilitation. This study aims at understanding the motivational requirements of stroke patients in doing rehabilitative exercises and living in a post-stroke life. Based on the findings from the literature review, we report that there are many factors that can influence the stroke patients' level of motivation such as social functioning, patient-therapist relationship, goal-setting, and music. These findings are insightful and useful for ideating and designing interactive motivation-driven games for stroke patients. The motivational factors of stroke patients in rehabilitation may help the game designers to design motivation-driven game contexts, contents, and gameplay. Moreover, these findings may help not only game designers but also healthcare professionals who concern stroke patient's motivation in rehabilitative context.",

It includes a set of requirements and guidelines in three macro areas namely, technical, management and commercial. EIR, which are specific to the construction industry in Qatar, do not exist yet despite BIM is increasingly adopted across the Qatari construction industry. However, construction projects using BIM in Qatar adopts various aspects in technical, management and commercial areas. In this paper, we analyze the current BIM practice in Qatar and compare the findings against the items of the three EIR's areas. The overarching aim is to assess the potential of delivering EIR in BIM based construction projects in Qatar. To accomplish this aim, major construction industry players (clients, consultants, contractors), representing a significant part of Qatar construction industry, were interviewed about the three EIR's areas and their items. The results showed discrepancies in addressing EIR and varied levels of readiness in delivering the different EIR's areas and items.

abstract="The IETF designed the Routing Protocol for Low power and Lossy Networks (RPL) as a candidate for use in constrained networks. Keeping in mind the different requirements of such networks, the protocol was designed to support multiple routing topologies, called DODAGs, constructed using different objective functions, so as to optimize routing based on divergent metrics. A DODAG versioning system is incorporated into RPL in order to ensure that the topology does not become stale and that loops are not formed over time. However, an attacker can exploit this versioning system to gain an advantage in the topology and also acquire children that would be forced to route packets via this node. In this paper we present a study of possible attacks that exploit the DODAG version system. The impact on overhead, delivery ratio, end-to-end delay, rank inconsistencies and loops is studied.",

abstract="The number of Internet of Things systems in which the general population is involved keeps increasing. At the same time, the configuration and adaptation of these systems to their users' preferences are still mostly manual. To achieve a better personalization of these systems comprehensive virtual profiles of their users, including as much information as possible, is needed. One of the most relevant information of a user virtual profile is his location. With the rise of the bluetooth low energy protocol and the appearance of the beacon technology, indoor positioning of smartphone owners can be added to these virtual profiles. However, the lack of a beacon standard and the low level information provided by these devices is hindering its adoption. To solve this, this paper presents a Beacon Management System that abstracts applications developers from the low level details of the different beacons protocols and allows the management of unregistered beacons. The proposed system has been integrated into the People as a Service computation model and in the commercial platform nimBees to improve the creation of virtual profiles in IoT applications.",

abstract="The approach presented in this position paper aims at collaborative service fusion and provisioning in user-centric environments in the future Internet of People, Things, and Services (IoPTS). Our approach connects dynamic gathering of user requirements and feedback with community based service fusion in any phase of a service life cycle. These highly adaptive services allow agile service creation and exploitation embedding the users by fusing his or her cloud based daily activities within intelligent environments. We propose two fundamental new building blocks: On the one hand a life management platform in our approach empowers users to manage service fusions, profiles, and access policies in a secure, trustworthy and unified way increasing their independency, privacy and possibilities to manage lives after personal priorities by personalized information flow. On the other hand the introduction of a service fusion engine supports automated access to personal consumer data and requirements for specifically authorized services and market places. Note: We think that with respect to recent discussions on profiling citizens and consumers user control and consent need to be re-balanced. As such the proposed life management platform is supposed to enable users to manage personally identifiable information.",

abstract="We are surrounded by an enormous amount of microprocessors. Their quantity outnumbers the human population by a factor of more than three. These microprocessors enable most technological artifacts to become intelligent ``things that think'' and a majority of these intelligent objects will be linked together to an ``Internet of things''. This omnipresent virtual ``organism'' will provide ubiquitous computing to an amount which goes far beyond all presently existing systems. To master this emerging virtual organism, completely new paradigms of operation have to evolve. In this paper we present our vision of establishing self-coordination as the dominant paradigm of operation of future ubiquitous computing environments. This vision is looked at from four different points of view. First of all techniques to model self-coordinating distributed systems in an adequate manner is discussed. Then the principle of self-coordination is applied to individual intelligent objects. In a next step such objects have to be arranged in a networked manner. Again the potential of self-coordination, now applied to communication infrastructures is studied. Finally self-coordination is applied to next generation interfaces between human beings an artificial ones. In this paper we do not attempt to provide a complete discourse of the area. Instead of this we try to illustrate the four aspects mentioned above by proper examples.",

In this paper, we propose a 2-stage approach for robust heart rate (HR) calculation from photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal, captured using smartphones. Firstly, Normalized Least Mean Square (NLMS) based adaptive filter is used to clean up the noisy PPG signal. Then, heart rate is calculated from the frequency spectrum, which is further fine-tuned using different interpolation techniques. Experimental results, show that the overall HR calculation improves significantly due to the proposed 2-stage approach.",

abstract="One of the most important challenges of this decade is the Internet of Things (IoT) that pursues the integration of real-world objects in the virtual world of the Internet. One property that characterises IoT systems is that they have to react to variable and continuous changes. This means that IoT systems need to work as self-managed systems to effectively manage context changes. The autonomy property inherent to software agents makes them a suitable choice for developing self-managed IoT systems. By embedding agents in the devices that compose the IoT is possible to realize a decentralized system with self-management capacities. However, in this scenario new problems arise. Firstly, current agent development approaches lack mechanisms to deal with the heterogeneity present in the IoT domain. Secondly, agents must simultaneously deal with potentially conflicting changes in their behaviour, concerning self-management and application goals. In order to afford these challenges we propose to use an approach based on Dynamic Software Product Lines (D-SPL) and preference-based reasoning. The D-SPL provides to the preference-based reasoning of the agent with the necessary information to adapt its behaviour at runtime making a trade-off between the self-management of the system and the accomplishment of its application goals.",

This paper presents the telemetry system for diagnosis of Asthma and COPD (COPD - Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a type of obstructive lung disease characterized by long-term poor airflow). Developed telemetry system is implemented using Android, Java, MATLAB and PHP technologies. Classification of respiratory diseases is implemented in our previous papers. During the six months' period telemetry system was tested on 541 subjects, where 324 were classified as asthmatics or COPD while 217 were classified as healthy subjects. Implemented system uses a spirometer connected via Bluetooth with a mobile phone application for sending data to the server where is installed Expert System for classification of Asthma and COPD.

We present a user study (nÂ =Â 64) of an Exergame for AAL environments with the research foci performance and acceptance. Age is the predominant factor for performance, while the intention to use is determined by gaming frequency. Neither technical self-efficacy nor age had considerable influence on these measures.

As a result of the technological evolution, new tools such as serious games are emerging, so their use in the field of physical therapy can modify the way patients face their treatments, promoting their motivation.

abstract="Software forms an integral part of the most complex artifacts built by humans. Communication, production, distribution, healthcare, transportation, banking, education, entertainment, government, and trade all increasingly rely on systems driven by software. Such systems may be used in ways not anticipated at design time as the context in which they operate is constantly changing and humans may interact with them an unpredictable manner. However, at the same time, we are able to collect unprecedented collections of event data describing what people and organizations are actually doing. Recent developments in process mining make it possible to analyze such event data, thereby focusing on behavior rather than correlations and simplistic performance indicators. For example, event logs can be used to automatically learn end-to-end process models. Next to the automated discovery of the real underlying process, there are process mining techniques to analyze bottlenecks, to uncover hidden inefficiencies, to check compliance, to explain deviations, to predict performance, and to guide users towards ``better'' processes. Process mining reveals how people really work and often reveals what they would really like to do. Event-based analysis may reveal workarounds and remarkable differences between people and organizations. This keynote paper highlights current research on comparative process mining. One can compare event data with normative process models and see where people deviate. Some of these deviations may be positive and one can learn from them. Other deviations may reveal inefficiencies, design flaws, or even fraudulent behavior. One can also use process cubes to compare different systems or groups of people. Through slicing, dicing, rolling-up, and drilling-down we can view event data from different angles and produce process mining results that can be compared.",

abstract="Recently, more and more sensor network research is carried out in the area of remote and mobile health systems (mHealth) or Telemedicine applications. In these applications the sensors are centered in or on the proximity of the human body thereby forming a network called Wireless Body Area Network (WBAN) that is uniquely important for consideration. Hot problems currently researched in this network include reliability and energy efficiency of routing protocols.Â Â In this paper we present the analysis of three prominent routing protocols AODV, DSR and DSDV, based on the key characteristics of the WBAN using IEEE 802.15.4 MAC Protocol. In our experiments, packet delivery ratio and average end-end delay were used as the measure for the communication reliability and energy savings efficiency, while considering the mobility of the nodes, network communication range and the number of nodes. Based on the experimental analysis, both AODV and DSR protocols have good reliability, while DSDV performed very poorly with over 90 percent packet losses largely due to itsÂ high routing table overhead. Furthermore, in energy savings efficiency, DSR and AODV had similar performance while DSDV performed a little poorer.",

However, the process of eliciting and writing security requirements is tedious and complex, It requires Requirements Engineers (RE) to have security experience in the process of eliciting consistent security requirements from the clients-stakeholders. Considering the requirements are derived from natural language, RE faced problems in eliciting and writing security requirements as they have the tendency to misunderstand the real needs and the security terms used. Motivated from these problems, this paper proposed a security requirements library and template to assist RE in writing security requirements. The library was built based on compilation of security attributes derived from syntax analysis and keywords matching. The realization of the library and writing template was demonstrated using two sets of scenario taken from real projects. The usage examples show that the template is able to help the RE to write security requirements by providing the relevant and suitable sentence structure as guidance.",

The proposed technology includes design, integration, and operational strategies of IP-WSN based territorial monitoring system to ensure compatibility and interoperability. We especially offer the standardizations of sensing data formats and their database interfaces, which enable a spontaneous and systematic integration among the legacy WSN systems.

A communication retarder was used to create delays from 0 to 100Â ms between a receiving computer and three different USB-connected computer input devices. A wired mouse, a wifi mouse and a head-mounted mouse were used as input devices. The results of the user tests show that delays upÂ to 50Â ms could be tolerated and are not perceived as delay, or depending on the used device still perceived as acceptable.",

abstract="Family care is the most accepted and preferred care setting for both long-term care patients and their relatives. However, many of these caregivers are elderly people themselves, and often reach the point where they also need support. Care poses a substantial burden, so often it is not the health of the patient but the overload of stress for the caregiver that results in the need for much more expensive professional care and even residential care. An ambient assisted living technology platform is developed to support both older adults and their carers to overcome the challenges of the care. The platform offers informal carers support by means of monitoring Activities of Daily Care as well as their psychological state, and will provide orientation to help them improve the care given. Monitored information will be registered by means of home-installed and personal sensor technologies based on Internet of Things (IoT), which will be as unobtrusive as possible for the house inhabitants.",

abstract="The increase in life expectancy and the consequent aging of the general population pose, nowadays, major challenges to modern societies. Most elderly people have the usual problems related to old age, like health chronic problems and sensory and cognitive impairments. Besides that, in today's modern societies, where families have less and less time to look after for their old relatives, the isolation of the elderly is a real concern and a very current problem, which is enhanced if the elders live alone. To solve or, at least, mitigate that problem, it was developed a smart home for elders that is presented and described in this paper. The developed assistive home system, which is based on available technology, can ensure the quality of life, safety and well-being of all older adults that want or desire to live in the comfort of their home, near to their friends and in their neighborhood, instead of living in elder care centers. The proposed solution can record and analyze the elders' daily routines in order to alert (e.g., e-mails or text messages) the family members and/or social agents (e.g., doctors and caregivers) whenever an unusual situation occurs or when the elder is in danger, provide real-time audio and video when necessary and some comfort features, such as, automatic lighting and temperature control. The relevant events are recorded and maintained in a cloud database, which can be accessed through a dedicated website or by an Internet of Things (IoT) Application Programming Interface (API). Although this type of solution/service is focused in the elderly population, anybody can use it. The developed solution provides comfort and safety to elders and, at the same time, an easier way of monitoring all important events.",

These new applications introduce tremendous new capabilities such as the ability to monitor, manage and control devices remotely, and to create new insights and actionable information from massive streams of real-time data. Supporting this new approach requires the adoption of new paradigms. In this paper, agent tecnology is combined with the emergent concept of Fog computing to design control systems based on the decentralization of control functions over distributed autonomous and cooperative entities that are running at the edge of the network. We describe the Rainbow platform that is designed to bring computation as close as possible to the physical part. Multi-agent systems running on top of Rainbow create smart services using adaptive and decentralized algorithms which exploit the principles of collective intelligence.",

However, current systems are independent to each other, which means that resources for ubiquitous computing are separated and applications could not be created on cross-platform. The openness, simplicity, flexible and standardization of Web have given insights of building up a more uniform, open and scalable service environment for ubiquitous computing.

abstract="With the rising interest in internet connected devices and sensor networks, better known as the Internet of Things, data streams are becoming ubiquitous. Integration and processing of these data streams is challenging. Semantic Web technologies are able to deal with the variety of data but are not able to deal with the velocity of the data. An emerging research domain, called stream reasoning, tries to bridge the gap between traditional stream processing and semantic reasoning. Research in the past years has resulted in several prototyped RDF Stream Processors, each of them with its own features and application domain. They all cover querying over RDF streams but lack support for complex reasoning. This paper presents how adaptive stream processing and context-awareness can be used to enhance semantic reasoning over streaming data. The result is a federated context-aware architecture that allows to leverage reasoning capabilities on data streams produced by distributed sensor devices. The proposed solution is stated by use cases in pervasive health care and smart cities.",

IoT enable interconnection of embedded devices capable of running application like smart grid, smart traffic control, remote health monitoring etc. As the IoT devices can be connected virtually as well as physically, cyber attacks are likely to become a major threat. An attacker who have an access to the on-board network connecting IoT devices or appliances can spy on people, can inject malicious code into these embedded devices creating serious security concerns. In this work, we propose a framework to monitor security threats possible on IoT devices. The framework consists of several modules like data capture, anomaly detector and alert generator. The data capture module collects the application level data, transport and network headers of the traffic that goes into the IoT device. The anomaly detector module uses a signature based approach to detect threats. The proposed framework is tested on a testbed comprising of Arduino boards with Wiznet Ethernet shield as the IoT device communicate with Samsung Android smart-phone over a bridge connected through WiFi. We ran SNORT Intrusion Detector on the bridge with rules for generating alerts for intrusion.",

abstract="Many current context-aware systems only react to the current situation and context changes as the occur. In order to anticipate to future situations and exhibit proactive behavior, these systems should also be aware of their future context. Since predicted context is uncertain and can be wrong, applications need to be able to assess the quality of the predicted context information. This allows applications to make a well-informed decision whether to act on the prediction or not. In this paper, we present prediction quality metrics to evaluate the probability of future situations. These metrics are integrated in a structured prediction component development methodology, which is illustrated by a health care application scenario. The metrics and the methodology address the needs of the developer aiming to build context-aware applications that realize proactive behavior with regard to past, present and future context.",

abstract="Water depletion is critical in the dry tropics due to drought, increased development and demographic or economic shifts. Although educational initiatives have improved urban indoor water-use, excessive outdoor wastage still occurs because in most urban areas residential users only have a biannual reading of quantity available to make informed or educated decisions on necessary or unnecessary consumption. For example, the average consumer will water lawns during a designated non-restricted time. The amount of water they use is determined arbitrarily (i.e., either by sight or by blocks of time). In many cases, water is wasted due to over saturation, automated sprinklers that cannot sense precipitation, poor placement of sprinkler direction, etc. Outdoor water use efficiency could be maximized if water flow was shut off when an area of lawn has had sufficient water based on a more intelligent monitoring system. This paper describes the development of an intelligent water management and information system that integrates real-time sensed data (soil moisture, etc.) and Web-available information to make dynamic decisions on water release for lawns and fruit trees. The initial pilot-prototype combines Semantic Technologies with Internet of Things to decrease urban outdoor water-use and educate residents on best water usage strategies.",

Our approach, PiE (Processes in Events), aims to identify and exploit interconnections between processes, without demanding the restructuring of their inner structure. Starting from a set of events generated by sensors and business processes (BPs), we propose a methodology for multiple process annotation. From the analysis of the events correlations, we can discover interconnections among processes of several organizations involved in the same goal and derived additional information about the processes being executed.

abstract="In recent years Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been deployed in wide range of applications from the health and environment monitoring to building and industrial control. However, the pace of prevalence of WSN is slower than anticipated by the research community due to several reasons including required embedded systems expertise for developing and deploying WSNs; use of proprietary protocols; and limits in scalability and reliability. In this paper we propose PyFUNSÂ (Python-based Framework for Ubiquitous Networked Sensors) to address these challenges. PyFUNSÂ handles low level and networking functionalities, using the services provided by Contiki, and leaves to the user only the task of application development in the form of Python scripts. This approach reduces required expertise in embedded systems to develop WSN based applications. PyFUNSÂ also uses 6LoWPAN and CoAP standard protocols to enable interoperability and ease of integration with other systems, pursuing the Internet of Things vision. Through a real implementation of PyFUNSÂ in two constrained platforms we proved its feasibility in mote devices, as well as its performance in terms of control delay, energy consumption and network traffic in several network topologies. As it is possible with PyFUNSÂ to easily compare performance of different deployments of distributed application, PyFUNSÂ can be used to identify optimal design of distributed application.",

abstract="One of the most prominent challenges commonly acknowledged by modern manufacturing industries is ``how to produce more with fewer resources?'' Nowhere is this more true than in the food sector due to the recent concerns regarding the long-term availability and security of food products. The unique attributes of food products such as the need for fresh perishable ingredients, health risks associated with inappropriate production environment, stringent storage and distributions requirements together with relatively short post-production shelf-life makes their preparation, production and supply considerably different to other manufactured goods. Furthermore, the impacts of climate change on our ability to produce food, the rapidly increasing global population, as well as changes in demand and dietary behaviours both within developed and developing countries urgently demands a need to change the way we grow, manufacture and consume our food products. This paper discusses a number of key research challenges facing modern food manufacturers, including improved productivity using fewer resources, valorisation of food waste, improving the resilience of food supply chains, localisation of food production, and utilisation of new sustainable sources of nutrition for provision of customised food products.",

abstract="In order to prevent the lack of appropriate respiratory ventilation which causes brain damage and critical problems, it is required to continuously monitor the breathing signal of a patient. There are different conventional methods for capturing respiration signal, such as polysomnography and spirometer. In spite of their accuracy, these methods are expensive and could not be integrated in a body sensor network. In this work, we present a real-time cloud-based respiration monitoring platform which allows the patient to continue treatment and diagnosis from different places such as home. These remote services are designed for patients who suffer from breathing problems or sleep disorders. Our system includes calibrated accelerometer sensor, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and cloud database. Based on the high correlation between spirometer and accelerometer signals, the Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA) has been applied on respiration signals. The obtained results show that DFA can be used as an efficient feature while classifying the healthy people from patients suffering from breath abnormalities.",

In this paper, we present the design and development of an activity-based framework aimed at enabling the real-time viewing of bidirectional activity states between the elderly and their caregivers. This framework seeks to overcome the limitations of existing ambient displays deployed in AAL settings, which are in most cases unidirectional and confined to the homes of its users. Our bidirectional activity-based framework, is based on an extensive literature review, expert advice and user feedback, which informed the design decisions about the product features and functionality. The system exploits a highly accurate activity recognition model to facilitate real-time activity awareness and an ``always connected'' service through portable interactive devices for stimulating social connectedness within the AAL domain.",

However, its simple architecture can easily be misused for malicious activities. One huge security threat concerning DNS is tunneling, which helps attackers bypass the security systems unnoticed. A DNS tunnel can be used for three purposes: as a command and control channel, for data exfiltration or even for tunneling another protocol through it. In this paper, we surveyed different techniques for DNS tunneling detection. We classified those first based on the type of data and then within the categories based on the type of analysis. We conclude with a comparison between the various detection techniques.

The overall outcomes are highly positive since, in each Latin American Higher Education Institution, all training actions were successful, the first didactical implementations were designed and ongoing in the current semester. In some cases, instead of one foreseen implementation, there are several. The most statistically conditioning factors which affected the outcomes were the pre-experience with remote labs, the pre-experience with VISIR and the training actions duration. The teachers' perceptions that most conditioned their enrollment in implementing VISIR in their courses were related to their consciousness of the VISIR effectiveness to teach and learn. The lack of time to practice and discuss their doubts and the fulfillment of their expectations in the training actions, also affected how comfortable in modifying their course curricula teachers were.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) is becoming one of hottest research topics. Elderly care is one of important applications in IoT, to grasp the situations around the elder people and then corresponding information can be sent to the care-givers to support the elder people. Abnormal activity detection is a particularly important task in the field, since the services should be immediately provided in such cases. Otherwise the elder people may be in danger. The existing approaches to this problem use some basic living patterns of the elder people, e.g. mobility per day, to detect abnormal activities. However, the detail abnormal activities in various specific situations cannot be detected, e.g., whether there is some abnormal activity when the elder people go to toilet, sleeps or eats something. To solve the above problem, in the paper, we propose a situation-aware abnormality detection system based on SVDD for the elder people. An experiment has been performed focusing on feasibility of the method and accuracy of the system to detect situations and abnormities from real sensors.",

MWSN needs higher bandwidth in MAC layer than traditional WSN. Although AMCP procotol works well in traditional WSN, it is difficult to meet the requirement of multiple-hop MWSN due to its half-duplex mode. Hence, a full-duplex mode is introduced based on the assumption that each node has two radios, and a high-speed multi-hop AMCP algorithm is proposed in this paper. Several data frames can be transmitted after each channel negotiation succeeds to reduce the frequency of channel competition.

abstract="In the paper conditions of development and implementation of transport systems with reference to the development of radio communication networks towards 5G are presented. First, general properties of next generation systems are mentioned and their architecture. Moreover, planned characteristics of B4G and 5G systems are depicted which can significantly contribute to the promotion and development of transport systems. In particular the paper covers new transmission mechanisms resulting from the development of the Internet of Things and M2M technology as well as related, for example: V2V or V2X. On the other hand, the issue has been analyzed against the background of the development of the so-called heterogeneous networks and used physical resource management mechanisms, reduction and coordination of inter-cell interference and handover problems. In particular attention was also drawn to the conditions of radio signals transmission in the context of high mobility of mobile terminals in transport systems.",

abstract="Many of conveniences are nowadays on the way to be smart; mobile phones, cars and power stations. Among them, mobile conveniences generate much of sensor data in company with the persons. Some of sensor data are required for processing at distant places in which the sensor data are aggregated, for capabilities of smartness. In the case of vehicles the sensor data are transmitted for malfunction detection and health monitoring of the vehicle in near future. The sensor data are substantially large in the amount of one vehicle's data by multiple kinds of sensors, and the amount of a number of vehicles' data gathered is huge to be received concurrently at some server. Further when the gathered data are to be aggregated in one system the management of the enormous data could determine the functionality of the system. In this work, a data abbreviation diminishes the amount to be transmitted, and the data negating a valid extent consist the majority of data to be aggregated exploiting the semantics of the sensor data gathered. This method is far different from the conventional compressions. The aggregated data are managed and displayed when necessary in one system tracing faulty cars in a region. Although the aggregated data are in a condensed form, complete ones are retrievable from the original server.",

Sustainability concerns economical, environmental and social aspects; among these issues, the last theme is the less argued in literature and this paper focuses on the social life cycle assessment of products. One of the crucial aspects of S-LCA, is the definition of impact categories and involved stakeholders. This work, proposes a new S-LCA methodology, according to UNEP/SETAC framework. After the clarification of stakeholders, categories and general notions already known on S-LCA, a test case is shown where the new approach is implemented. In this use case, stakeholders from an Italian product line are analysed, then categories of attribution of social impacts are outlined. The paper offers a step-by-step procedure useful to verify the S-LCA theories currently available on a practical industrial case, defining also weaknesses that might be addressed in future studies.",

abstract="The way we are experiencing and interacting with our everyday living environment define and anticipate our future behavior and actions. Today new digital technologies vastly diminish boundaries between virtual and physical world. Cross-reality design supported with recent mobile and context aware computing, gradually changed the concept of user interaction and moved it more toward usage of heterogeneous contexts, pervasive computing technologies, and multimodal spatial perception and transformed our living surroundings into smart environments, traditional living object into smart living objects. Ubiquitous computing vision implies more than ever to our lives. In order to make all these changes more human-centered in this paper we are investigated the cognitive and metaphorical aspects of future interface design strategies which could enhance user experience and ideas acceptance, communicated through multimodal interactions. In this paper we are presenting three tangible interfaces that we have developed for design and research purposes and results we collected during their public exposure. Hopefully, the results will give us sufficient insights for further investigations in the field of smart living environments and smart objects development. We believe that to fulfill these goals application and exploration of tangible interfaces frameworks and cognitive methods could be one of the crucial elements for the future research success.",

The main objective of requirements engineering for big data is to capture big data service users' needs and provider's capabilities, and to identify value added service use cases for big data technology in a given organizational context. Major objectives may include: collect real-time data about the world, search for useful information in large data sets, gain insights about given problems by data analytics, predict possible trend of interesting subjects, and make decisions for the next immediate actions. In this paper, we propose a big data service requirements analysis framework, which aims to provide useful guidelines for eliciting service requirements, selecting the right services architectures and evaluate the available technological services implementations. For services under operation, we suggest data analysis to service logs to elicit user's changing needs, to evaluate the run-time service performance and to check compliance to general standards and domain-specific regulations. Example cases from eHealth and industry 4.0 are discussed to illustrate the proposed service requirements framework.",

abstract="Pathological shaking of the body or extremities is widely known and might occur at chronic diseases e.g. Parkinson. The rhythmical shaking, also known as tremor, can be such intense that extremities are flapping. Under certain circumstances, healthy people also show a shivering and shaking of their body. For example, humans start to shiver whenever it is too cold or if feelings such as stress or fear become dominant. Some wearable devices that are in direct contact to the body, such as smartwatches or smartglasses, provide a sensing functionality of acceleration force that is sufficient to detect the tremor of the wearer. The tremor varies in frequency and intensity and can be identified, by applying detection algorithms and signal filtering. Former works figured that all endotherms show muscle vibrations. These vibrations occur in the condition of sleeping as well as when being awake, or in unconsciousness. Furthermore, the vibrations are also present when subjects are physically active, emotionally stressed, or absolutely relaxed. The vibration itself varies in structure, amplitude, and frequency. This paper shows that these muscle vibrations are measureable by acceleration sensors attached to the user, and provides an outlook to new applications in the future. It also proves that custom mobile devices are able to detect body and muscle vibration and should motivate designers to develop new applications and treatment opportunities.",

abstract="Researches in ambient assisted living have so far faced three important challenges: (1) Lack of a comprehensive approach to capture user needs that are generic; i.e., not limited to specific events, but as generic related to the user. (2) Lack of a highly flexible and scalable platform for the distributed sharing and processing of context between nodes in IoT networks. (3) Increased amount of communication and devices with sensors participating in the acquisition, processing and sharing of context further challenges both computation capability and storage capacity of the system. In this paper, we address these limitations and present novel support, applied in a system for remote assistance of elderly. The support comprehensively retrieves user needs from generic context, via a scalable overlay providing increment of processing capability and storage. Further, the support self-organizes entities into generic context from distributed sensing, using the Dependent Context Pattern (DCP) based on the Context Virtualizing Platform (CVP).",

It surveys the manifestation of PD symptoms, sensors that were used for their detection, types of signals (measures) as well as their signal processing (data analysis) methods. A summary of this review's finding is represented in a table including devices (sensors), measures and methods that were used in each reviewed motor symptom assessment study. In the gathered studies among sensors, accelerometers and touch screen devices are the most widely used to detect PD symptoms and among symptoms, bradykinesia and tremor were found to be mostly evaluated. In general, machine learning methods are potentially promising for this. PD is a complex disease that requires continuous monitoring and multidimensional symptom analysis. Combining existing technologies to develop new sensor platforms may assist in assessing the overall symptom profile more accurately to develop useful tools towards supporting better treatment process.",

abstract="6LoWPAN plays a major role within the protocol stack for the future Internet of Things. Its fragmentation mechanism enables transport of IPv6 datagrams with the required minimum MTU of 1280 bytes over 802.15.4-based wireless sensor networks. With the envisioned goal of a fully standardized WSN protocol stack currently necessitating a route-over approach, i.e. routing at the IP-layer, there are two main choices for any 6LoWPAN implementation with regard to datagram fragmentation: Hop-by-hop assembly or a cross-layered direct mode, which forwards individual 6LoWPAN fragments before the whole datagram has arrived. In addition to these two straightforward approaches, we propose enhancements based on adaptive rate-restriction for the direct forwarding and a retry control for both modes to reduce the number of losses of larger datagrams. Our evaluation of the basic and enhanced forwarding modes within simulations and a hardware testbed indicate that the proposed enhancements can considerably improve packet reception rate and latency within 6LoWPAN networks.",

Early detection can be accomplished by analysis of images of the retina, generally obtained by expensive fundus cameras.

In this paper, an approach for automatic retinal image analysis on a smartphone is proposed, with emphasis on high sensitivity and fast computation. A set of 1200 images from the Messidor database were analyzed for extraction of features related to vessel segmentation, presence of exudates and microaneurysms. SVM and k-NN classifier models were trained with these features, resulting in a sensitivity of 87{\%} and a specificity of 66{\%}.

In order to address the conflicting interests involved, we adopt a Game Theoretic approach that takes into consideration the strategies of both players and we attempt to identify the presence of Nash Equilibria in the two games. The results are then verified in two simulation contexts: Firstly, we evaluate the model in a middleware-based WSN which uses clustering over a bespoke network stack.

abstract="Wireless sensor nodes attached to everyday objects and worn by people are able to collaborate and actively assist users in their activities. We propose a method through which wireless sensor nodes organize spontaneously into clusters based on a common context. Provided that the confidence of sharing a common context varies in time, the algorithm takes into account a window-based history of believes. We approximate the behaviour of the algorithm using a Markov chain model and we analyse theoretically the cluster stability. We compare the theoretical approximation with simulations, by making use of experimental results reported from field tests. We show the tradeoff between the time history necessary to achieve a certain stability and the responsiveness of the clustering algorithm.",

abstract="The widely use of advanced technologies in the sensor network and computing has facilitated the development of convenient pervasive applications in order to access information at anytime and anywhere. The traditional access control mechanisms cannot appropriately protect the access and usage of digital resources in the highly distributed and heterogeneous computing environment. In such an environment, enforcing continuously the access control policies during the access period is a challenge because traditional authorization decisions are generally made at the time of access requests but do not consider ongoing controls. Obligations are the vital part of many access control policies and they specify mandatory behavior that should be conducted by a user of the access control system in sensitive domains. Therefore, utilizing a mechanism to approve the fulfillment of the obligation is required for continuing or revoking the access decision. We leveraged the capability of Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) to manage the communication between entities in order to provide a mechanism to handle the continuous enforcement of the obligation. Meanwhile, we present several scenarios which indicate our proposed model can manage the obligatory behavior that affects the continuity of access to resources in pervasive computing environment.",

abstract="Persuasive technology capitalizes on the use of technology and the art of persuasion to change the behaviors and attitudes of people without the use of coercion. They have been used at workplaces to achieve positive outcomes like increase in employee motivation, engagement and productivity. While a number of researchers have investigated the effectiveness of Cialdini's principles of persuasion, little or no research has been conducted in the context of work environments. In many workplaces, it is important that employees provide detailed records of their activities for easy tracking of an organization's day-to-day activities and future historical reference. However, research has shown that some employees find it difficult to comply. In an attempt to address this problem, we carried out a pilot study among 20 healthcare Applied Behavior Analysis(ABA) frontline employees, working with autistic patients. The study is aimed at investigating how effective Cialdini's principles of persuasion are in motivating employees to record details about the sessions they have with patients. A Two-Way Mixed ANOVA analysis showed that ABA frontline employees are most susceptible to Commitment and Reciprocity, followed by Authority, and least susceptible to Consensus and Scarcity. These results suggest that designers of gamified persuasive systems tailored to healthcare ABA frontline staff should focus on implementing Commitment, Reciprocity and Authority as persuasive strategies aimed at motivating them in engaging in sufficient and quality data entry.",

abstract="Hadoop has become a strategic data platform for by mainstream enterprises, adopted because it offers one of the fastest paths for businesses take to unlock value from big data while building on existing investments. Hadoop is a distributed framework based on Java that is designed to work with applications implemented using MapReduce modeling. This distributed framework enables the platform to pass the load to thousands of nodes across the whole Hadoop cluster. The nature of distributed frameworks also allows node failure without cluster failure. The Hadoop market is predicted to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the next several years. Several tools and guides describe how to deploy Hadoop clusters, but very little documentation tells how to increase performance of Hadoop clusters after they are deployed. This document provides several BIOS, OS, Hadoop, and Java tunings that can increase the performance of Hadoop clusters. These tunings are based on lessons learned from Transaction Processing Performance Council Express (TPCx) Benchmark HS (TPCx-HS) testing on a Cisco UCSÂ® Integrated Infrastructure for Big Data cluster. TPCx-HS is the industry's first standard for benchmarking big data systems. It was developed by TPC to provide verifiable performance, price-to-performance, and availability metrics for hardware and software systems that use big data.",

abstract="Logistics is a data-intensive industry. The information systems used by logistics companies generate massive volume of data which the companies store to perform different types of analysis. In addition, the advent of Big Data technologies and Internet of Things paradigm have given logistics companies an opportunity to use external data stemming from a wide variety of sources including sensors (e.g., GPS), social media and traffic controlling systems. The logistics companies aim to leverage the power of these external data and perform rigorous analysis in real-time to discover intelligence such as unpredictable delay. However, there are different challenges involved. One of the core challenges is integrating and processing a wide variety of data coming from heterogeneous sources. To the best of our knowledge, there is no off-the shelf solution which can address this challenge. In this paper, we present a framework called ProLoD which performs pre-processing and processing tasks with different types of data. Our framework relies on machine learning algorithms, for processing data; however, we found that the ready to use algorithms are not adequate to guarantee processing efficiency. Therefore, we extended an algorithm called Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm. We evaluated ProLoD by comparing its performance with the HCL algorithm found in the widely-adopted machine learning tool called WEKA. We found that ProLoD is performing reasonably better than WEKA in terms of producing optimal number of clusters.",

The paper presents new data processing algorithms for MCPS based on continuous wavelet transform (CWT). The proposed method provides an array of parameters characterizing frequency restructuring of medical signals in different frequency bands. Since frequency fluctuations in brain and heart rhythms are closely related to different processes in human organism, the obtained data can allow us: to identify the disease at its early stages; to test the adaptive capacity of the human organism; to give diagnostic reports on cardiovascular and nervous systems; to analyze changes in rhythm during biofeedback sessions. The techniques set forth in the paper can help in the creation of a unique ``rhythmic portrait'' of a person to diagnose his physiological state.",

To this end, complete IoT system and different devices which are working in home network management system will be presented in this paper. Applications for home network are considered under different architectures and their designs are discussed. Conventional simple network management protocol (SNMP) is generally applied for network management but it is not optimal due to lack of flexibility in configuring devices and lack of capabilities in managing operations in an IoT network.

abstract="Social Networks (SNs) become a major source of reporting new events that happen in real life even before the news channels and other media sources report them nowadays. The objective of this paper is to conduct the systematic literature review (SLR) to identify the most frequently used SN for reporting and analyzing the real-time events worldwide. Furthermore, we recognize the features and techniques used for mining the real-time events from SNs. To determine the literature related to event mining (EM) and SNs, the SLR process has been used. The SLR searching phase resulted 692 total studies from different online databases that went through three phases of screening, and finally 145 papers out of 692 were chosen to include in this SLR as per inclusion criteria and RQs. Based on the data analysis of the selected 145 studies, this paper has concluded that the Twitter micro-blogging SN is the most used SN to repot the events in textual format. The most common features used are n-gram and TF-IDF. Results also showed that support vector machine (SVM) and naive Bayes (NB) are the most frequently used techniques for SNEM. This SLR presents the list of SNs, features, and techniques that are reporting the SN events that can be helpful for other researchers for selection of SNs and techniques for their research.",

So far, standards from ISO, IEC, and EPCglobal provide a simple password protection for the access control or no protection at all. Therefore, many nonstandard solutions are being proposed using cryptographic primitives such as hash functions, private-key algorithms, and public-key algorithms.

This work performed is based on the four phases, which are first phase is raw data and after data processing using statistical features such as mean and standard deviation. The second phase is the sum of hertz, the third is the sum of hertz divided by the number of hertz, and last is the sum of hertz divided by total hertz. We are using five attributes that are patients, class, domain, location, and hertz. The data were classified using WEKA. The results showed that BayesNet gave a consistent result for all the phases from multilayer perceptron and K-Means. However, K-Mean gave the highest result in the first phase. Our results are based on a real-world data from Parkinson's patients.",

abstract="Aviation is a high competitive industry where actors should be first adopters for leading market or following adopters to survive. Traditional manufacturing techniques pass into the background, manufacturing systems require using additive technologies for rapid adaptation to current demand and reduction of production cycle duration. Many large mechanic and aircraft engineering companies have already adopted additive manufacturing technologies in their future production strategy. The general concept of 3D printer on the basis of e-manufacturing principles is aimed at integration of computer models of physical objects and processes. This change requires a deep transformation into enterprise business model, affecting either core or support activities. For instance, additive manufacturing could also change product lifecycle and supply chain management practices. This paper aims to identifying how these new technologies could improve support activities for aeronautical industry? Results show that additive manufacturing triggers a paradigm shift for aircraft lifecycle management and enable lean and agile practices for supply chain management.",

Business Process Management (BPM) and digital innovation are both ways for organizations to constantly improve, change and excel. Nonetheless, more research is needed on the intersection between these two approaches. While current literature acknowledges a link between BPM and digital innovation, this study digs deeper into the digital innovation strategies that organizations apply to incorporate technological transformations into their business processes.

Meanwhile, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been successfully used in precision agriculture and have a potential to be deployed in palm oil plantation. The success of using WSN to detect anomalous events in other domain reaffirms that WSN could be used to detect the presence of G. boninense, since WSN has some resource constraints such as energy and memory. This paper focuses on feature selection to ensure only significant and relevant data that will be collected and transmitted by the sensor nodes. Sixteen soil features have been collected from the palm oil plantation. This research used rough set technique to do feature selection. Few algorithms were compared in terms of their classification accuracy, and we found that genetic algorithm gave the best combination of feature subset to signify the presence of Ganoderma in soil.",

Reactive performance monitoring consists of automating strategic decisions into rule-based actions when appropriate. Often there is a response gap, where there is unnecessary latency or missing detail, as the mapping between the strategic, the operational and the analytical is complex, labor intensive and not clearly defined. This paper presents an OLAP-modeled rule environment that leverages Complex Event Processing (CEP), multi-dimensionally modeled On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) databases and Business Process Management (BPM) to provide reactive performance monitoring. We use two case studies to evaluate our proposed architecture for an OLAP-modeled rule environment. The first case study prototyped the environment using IBM PMQ, while the second prototyped the environment using QuickForms and a custom-built OLAP rule engine. Predictive modeling, traditional rule engines, and our OLAP rule engine are compared in terms of their support for reactive performance monitoring.",

abstract="As a special kind of Product Life cyle Management (PLM), Building Life cycle Management (BLM) is a centric activity for facility owners and managers. This fact motivates the adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) approaches as a way to achieve smart BLM strategies for cost reduction, facility knowledge management, and project synchronization among the different stakeholders. Unfortunately, the current BIM state of the art is tailored towards the management of new projects, while ongoing and completed AEC projects could hugely benefit from BIM integration for better BLM strategies. In this regards, it is absolutely necessary to acquire knowledge about the dynamic facility aspects (crowd movement, as-is updates, etc.). Up-to-date, 3D capture appears to be the only reliable way to cope with such situation. In this paper, we analyze 3D capture techniques, ranging from photogrammetry to 3D scanning, with an emphasis on helping 3D capture practitioners to make critical decisions about the choice of adequate acquisition technologies for a particular application. We discuss 3D capture techniques by exposing their pros and cons, according to several relevant criteria, and synthesize our analysis by developing a set of recommendations to enhance the life expectancy of buildings via the integration of BIM into Life Cycle Management (LCM) of the built environment and its buildings.",

abstract="Emergency management needs to detect diverse events, covering non-spontaneous events and spatio-temporal events, and notify the related personnelas soon as possible so that they can make further decisions. This paper introduces how to carry out event detection and notification by exploiting content-based Pub/Sub systems, and it also summarizes our work progress in this field. Through describing our event detection language and its application examples, the paper demonstrates the event detection capability of our Pub/Sub systems. Furthermore, this paper explains subscription/event routing strategies employed in our Pub/Sub systems constructed in different network environments (including cloud and VANETs), and these strategies serve for dynamic load balance and efficient event notification, respectively.",

abstract="The popular concept of SmartHome means that the appliances such as lighting, heating and door locks are controllable remotely through for example remote controls or mobile phones. The concept is becoming more and more realizable due to recent advancements in Internet-enabled technologies. SmartHomes can become even more intelligent and automated by exploiting such intelligent and affordable Internet-enabled technologies. However, this necessitates a context-aware system that provides services to respond to the context changes to enable such SmartHome automation at the edge of today's context-centric networks. To this end, this paper designs and develops a context-aware reasoning service for home automation which provides a novel way to connect SmartHomes through the use of a distributed context exchange network overlay. It enables mobility service application to communicate with and control SmartHomes remotely.",

abstract="Smart objects are devices with computational and communication capabilities connected to the Internet forming the so called Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT enables many applications, for instance outdoor lighting control, smart energy and water management, or environmental sensing in a smart city environment. Security in such scenarios remains an open challenge due to the resource-constrained nature of devices and networks or the multiple ways in which opponents can attack the system during the lifecycle of a smart object. This paper firstly reviews security and operational goals in an IoT scenario inspired in a smart city environment. Then, we present a comprehensive and lightweight security architecture to secure the IoT throughout the lifecycle of a device. Our solution relies on the lightweight HIMMO scheme -- a novel key pre-distribution scheme that is both collusion resistance and efficient -- as the building stone enabling not only efficient resource-wise but also advanced and scalable IoT protocols and architectures. Our design and analysis show that our HIMMO-based security architecture can be easily integrated in existing communication protocols such as IEEE 802.15.4 or OMA LWM2M providing a number of advantages that existing solutions cannot provide both performance and operation-wise.",

To this end, this work applies density based clustering algorithms on gait and trajectory IoT data recorded from real senior homes (``on the wild''). The indoor analytics client analyzes high density regions rendered from locations in real senior homes facilitated by IoT technology consisting of events describing the seniors' position. These are collected, analyzed and made available by the indoor analytics client taking into account the available processing resources and configuring itself to deliver the analytics outcome even when it is hosted in hardware with constrained resources. Promising results are obtained by analyzing a whole week's data in two seniors' homes. The algorithm performance and accuracy with respect to the number of points included in the analysis are presented and discussed.",

abstract="The purpose of this work is to develop a non-intrusive low-cost system capable of detecting faults and register working hours of Internal Combustion (IC) engines. The system should allow the monitoring of combustion engines usage, detect faults remotely, and is focused on IC engines for maritime applications. It consists of two parts, as explained in the following. The first part involves the development of the device, which should be capable of performing a continuous monitoring of an engine's activity and register its working periods. This decision is made based on the vibration analysis. As a requirement, the developed device must be low-cost, portable and have a low energy consumption to provide at least two years of autonomy. The second part involves fault's detection and, like the first part, it requires information from the engine's vibrations. A low power accelerometer will be used to monitor the engine's activity, and a piezoelectric polyvinylidene fluoride film is used to record the engine's vibration, for fault detection. The data is then sent via Bluetooth to the user's smartphone, which forwards it to the Internet, for further analysis. Bluetooth Low Energy is used to support the required autonomy. The developed technique for fault detection includes data acquisition, analog and digital pre-processing and digital processing. The most important part of the digital processing, in this case, is a Time-Frequency Analysis. Several Time-Frequency Analysis algorithms were tested with real data to select the best solution to detect faults in such engines.",

These artifacts will be later on used to develop the software components (not necessarily services) automating or supporting business process activities. Our envisioned approach is based on a three-steps model transformation chain: (1) we refine the BPMN as-is model; (2) we apply process re-engineering and automation patterns to generate the BPMN to-be model; and (3) we use the resulting to-be BPMN model to derive analysis and design software artifacts.

In this paper, we present a protocol based on the homomorphic property of Goldwasser-Micali cryptosystem to protect each user's location in proximity queries. However, an active adversary could learn, if two users are ``close'' to each other due to the vulnerability of the Goldwasser-Micali to IND-CCA2 attacks and malleability of homomorphic encryption schemes. Our protocol solves this problem with the authenticated encryption scheme called encrypt-then-mac [5].

abstract="The Internet of Things promises a continuous flow of data where traditional database and data-mining methods cannot be applied. This paper presents a novel variant of the well-known Self-Organized Map (SOM), called Ubiquitous SOM (UbiSOM), that is being tailored for streaming environments. This approach allows ambient intelligence solutions using multidimensional clustering over a continuous data stream to provide continuous exploratory data analysis. The average quantization error over time is used for estimating the learning parameters, allowing the model to retain an indefinite plasticity and to cope with concept drift within a multidimensional stream.",

The online portal helps teachers to find age-appropriate media to introduce their students to global challenges such as the greenhouse effect, renewable energies, or the production of clean drinking water. To strengthen the formation of values during experimentation, the Siemens Stiftung is taking a new path: the development of a gaming module, which is based on the principle of learning through discovery. This means that children and young people actively shape their individual learning processes while playing, discovering and understanding scientific and technological interrelationships through Moral Dilemma Situations. They themselves develop questions independently, work out answers using a variety of methods and reflect on the solutions.

Problem: There is need to guide the selection of appropriate combinations of technologies supporting or improving justice systems, yet there is no adapted approach focusing on this concern. Objective: This paper aims to develop the basis of a modeling approach supporting the selection of technologies relevant to justice systems. Method: Goal-oriented requirements modeling is used to describe and evaluate the contribution of technology in the context of justice systems, with the help of an illustrative example targeting the improvement of access to justice. Results: The example shows that it is feasible to model the technology alternatives and their contributions to the goals of different stakeholders in justice systems so that selected technologies are well-aligned with the needs of such systems. Goal models also support trade-off analysis in this context. Conclusion: A justice-aware modeling approach has the potential of helping justice stakeholders to better reason about technology selection and document the rationale of their choices. There are however many remaining challenges in the generalization of the approach to other cases and in its validation in practice.",

abstract="The earlier era of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) is extending its hands towards Internet-of-Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS). The emergence of new technologies using WSNs leads to the dire need of real-time implementations to be utilized in typical applications like health care, agriculture, industries, and much more. These sensors are generally characterized by several limitations such as limited energy availability, low memory, and reduced processing power. Routing in WSNs is a well-studied research domain leaving several holes for further research. A large number of network routing algorithms have been developed to effectively pass the sensor data from individual nodes to base station. This paper presents an implementation case study using Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) heuristic for an energy efficient routing in WSNs. The real-time experiments were carried out using iSense proprietary hardware and software platform for WSNs. Many practical challenges like neighbor detection failure, packet loss, interference from external objects were taken into consideration and ACO algorithm was modified accordingly to successfully solve those problems. The results achieved are reported in this paper.",

abstract="In the world of Internet of Things (IoT), huge number of resource constrained devices are directly accessible over the Internet. For allowing the constrained devices to exchange information, the IETF standard group has specified the CoAP which works on top of UDP/IP. Also, Datagram TLS (DTLS) binding is recommended to make the CoAP secure. When DTLS is enabled, a device can select one of three security modes that are PreSharedKey, RawPublicKey and Certificate mode. Especially, the RawPublicKey mode, which uses an asymmetric-key pair without a certificate, is mandatory to implement CoAP over DTLS. But there are several challenges in using the asymmetric-key based secure mode in resource constrained device. This paper compares the RawPublicKey mode and the PreSharedKey mode, which uses a symmetric-key, to discuss DTLS performance in resource constrained devices and networks. For the comparison, we implemented an experimental environment based on IEEE 802.15.4 wireless networks consisting of resource constrained devices in the Cooja Simulator and in the real test-bed as well. Then we analyze the comparison results with regard to code size, energy consumption and processing and receiving time.",

abstract="Due to the uncertainty of what actual adaptations will be performed at run time, verifying adaptive systems at design time may lead to limited results or may even be infeasible. Run-time verification techniques have been proposed to cope with this uncertainty. Recently, there has been an increasing interest to use model checking (an important verification technique) at run time in order to verify the expected properties of adaptive systems. Given a system specification and expected system properties, a model checker determines whether or not the specification satisfies its properties in the presence of self-adaptation. One key concern is the generally high resource needs of model checking, which may prohibit its use on resource- and power-constrained devices, such as smart-phones or Internet-of-Things devices. To address this challenge, we introduce a cloud-based framework that delivers model checking as a service (MCaaS). MCaaS offloads computationally intensive model checking tasks to the cloud, thereby offering verification capabilities on demand. Adaptive systems running on any kind of connected device may take the advantages of model checking at run time by invoking the MCaaS service. To dynamically allocate the required cloud resources (CPU and memory), we employ machine learning to estimate the resource usage of an actual model checking task at run time. As proof of concept, we implement and validate the approach for the case of probabilistic model checking, which facilitates verifying typical properties such as reliability.",

abstract="Key management has always remained a challenging problem for the entire security community. Standard practice in modern times is to agree on symmetric keys using public key protocols. However, public key protocols use heavy computations; rendering them inappropriate for application to low cost devices of Internet of Things (IoT). This led to proposals of various key management strategies for low cost networks; a prominent discovery being key predistribution technique for Wireless Sensor Network (WSN)--a prototype of IoT. Such schemes require several communicating nodes to share the same cryptographic key. This leads to interesting (combinatorial) graphical models and related optimality problems, that get intense for hierarchical architecture. Most protocols meant for hierarchical (low cost) networks employ separate designs for individual levels and/or clusters. Consequently only local optimal values can be computed. We develop a single universal platform using weighted signed graph (WSG) that designs the entire network for a hierarchical setup. This model can be used as itself or clubbed with a key predistribution scheme (KPS) to enhance the latter's security when applied to a WSN. After generic presentation, we combine our universal model with prominent KPS to facilitate comparative study with existing protocols.",

Using this modified version of the Scratch language, we demonstrate usage cases in which novice programmers can program appliances, increasing their functionality and ability to be customized.

In this paper, we propose a methodology to increase the security of the MQTT protocol, by including Usage Control in its operative workflow. The inclusion of usage control enables a fine-grained dynamic control of the rights of subscribers to access data and data-streams over time, by monitoring mutable attributes related to the subscriber, the environment or data itself. We will present the architecture and workflow of MQTT enhanced through Usage Control, also presenting a real implementation on Raspberry Pi 3 for performance evaluation.",

abstract="Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSANs) will represent a key building block for the future Internet of Things, as a cheap and easily-deployable technology to connect smart devices on a large scale. In WSAN implementation, the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) has a crucial role as the standard IPv6-based routing protocol. The RPL specifications define a basic set of security features based on cryptography. Without these features, RPL would be vulnerable to simple yet disruptive routing attacks based on forgery of routing control messages. However, the impact of these features on the performances of the WSAN has not been investigated yet. The contribution of this paper is twofold: an implementation of the RPL security features for the Contiki operating system, which is, at the best of authors' knowledge, the first available, and an evaluation of their impact on the WSAN performances by means of simulations. We show that the protection against eavesdropping and forgery attacks has a modest impact on the performances, whereas the protection against replay attacks has a more considerable impact, especially on the network formation time which increases noticeably.",

A new strategy should look for collective decisions for improving performance considering the sustainable criteria of the economic, the environmental and the social aspects. It became necessary to develop an interactive decision making that considers the conflicting opinion to select the best compromise strategy. Nevertheless, ambiguity and collaboration decision modalities of different decision-makers are not considered in the real case.

On its turn, when queried, a Slave Node replies to the Master Node. The performance of the proposed routing schemes is evaluated and compared on the basis of experimental results involving a real indoor WSN composed of 11 Telos motes, representing 1 Master Node and 10 Slave Nodes. The WSN has been deployed inside ISMB Lab. The analysis is based on performance metrics such as end-to-end delay and end-to-end packet delivery success rate, also considering the impact of the distance between two adjacent nodes and thus the expected number of neighbors within a node radio coverage.",

To collect the seamless and sustainable UPD small data, we use the wearable computing sensors and applications for small data mining, filter, information visualization and interaction design. By information sorting the wearable computing into five types (in me, on me, with me, around me, beyond me), we intend to design the user experience in a sustainable way by Quantified Self. With the context awareness, conscious awareness and emotion awareness, we use LBS (location-based service) to construct context awareness, set up big five personalities and Enneagram to deal with the data of conscious awareness. For the Green IT Products, we set up the eco system information architecture and agile interaction model for the user experience design, we also use pre-conscious, sub-conscious and conscious awareness big data to analyze and predict the long-term impaction factors for the user experience and users' intuitive interaction. From the strategy level, structure level, framework level and visual level, we point out the Meaning-Centered Design methodology to dig out the user experience design for the Green IT Products, green and live information architecture for the life cycle evaluation for the Green IT products, figure out the stakeholder and interaction logic moving line by mapping the mental model for the diversified users' agile transformation needs, emotions and interaction feedback, provide the mass customization and crowds innovation contents to support the Green IT products and Product Service System (PSS), modify the quality of the real physical products and enrich the virtual reality digital information contents to prolong the life cycle of the Green IT Products. By decreasing the carbon footprint and increasing the three flows (information flow, logistics, financial flow) chain touchpoints, we find the painpoints and design the good user experience for the real people. We construct the user engagement innovation platform and transform the users' function with duality role player with user and designer. For the evaluation of the user experience, we change the scenario role player design into `real design for real people', and with the agile interaction and intuitive interaction, we modify the user experience with the real time high-fidelity prototype and iterative usability testing. In the pilot study, we design the smart clothes and interactive stage, props to collect the dancer's small data about the heart-beat, EMG, EEG, motion, body gesture, emotion and the audience feedback such as the sound of clapping, the environment light change, the audience moving line and the air smog haze index. We use the module and separate design for the clothes and sensors, memory metal, fiber-optical to balance the clothes light change, clothes form transformation and small data visualization. On the one hand, the clothes can collect the dancer's action data in an active way, at the same time, the clothes also interact with the dancer, the audience and the stage environment to support the digital contents of the dance. One clothes can express the five scenes of the dance in a sustainable way. And because of the separate design, the clothes and the sensors play the role in a parallel way to leave the dancer plenty of free uncertainty expression space. That win-win design support the real and virtual parts life cycle for the Green IT Products. We use the expert review, heuristic evaluation, big data visual analytics and usability testing for the user experience design evaluation and design the third version for the smart clothes and interactive stage.",

IoT supports the concept of smart city, which aims to provide different services for the administration of the city and for the citizens. The important application of IoT is Structural Strength Recognition (SSR). This approach is becoming popular to increase the safety of buildings and human life. Proper maintenance of historical buildings requires continuous monitoring and current conditions of it. Sensor nodes are used to collect data of these historical buildings or large structures. Structural strength recognition covers huge geographical area and it requires continuous monitoring of it. It involves more energy consumption during these activities. Hence, there is need for efficient energy management technique. Clustering is one of the important techniques for energy management in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). It helps in reducing the energy consumed in wireless data transmission.

abstract="In this world, everyone is connected, and things become interactive. The eventual fate of the intuitive world relies upon the future Internet of Things (IoT). Smart building is an important aspect of the IoT. During traffic and evacuation, to facilitate the passage of occupants, signage systems are widely used in the built environment. Due to the complex layout of large buildings, rapid evacuation is making way finding difficult. The need for exit signs that take into account when this should be evident, redirecting individuals to not only an exit but rather a practical and optimal way out in an evolving emergency situation has facilitated the improvement of another era of cutting edge signage. Conventional signage cannot adapt to changing conditions because it only conveys single and passive information, and displays static content with limited user interactivity. To address this issue, in this paper, we propose a dynamic active emergency signage system architecture `DSS-SL' based of SDN. We also present a low power LED-based visible lighting communication between smart devices and forwarding switches inside the building.",

abstract="The advent of the Internet of Things and the increasing sensorization of smart devices that surround us in our everyday lives are spurring the demand for context-aware applications to offer personalized services. With the rapid advances in sensor technology, distributed software architectures and backend infrastructures need to be able to systematically deal with increasing amounts of real-time context data. In this paper, we present an approach for intelligent service clouds to cater for the new challenges associated with complex context-aware applications. Based on an illustrative scenario from the connected car domain, we introduce a detailed system model and approach for context-based personalization of mobile services. Our solution focuses on a three-phase approach with context change analysis, context state management, and context-triggered adaptation actions. We discuss details of our prototype implementation and put the contributions into perspective with the related work. After discussing our preliminary results, we draw a roadmap for future work towards context-aware vehicle information systems.",

abstract="This paper describes biometric-based cryptographic techniques that use weak secrets to provide strong, multi-factor and mutual authentication, and establish secure channels for subsequent communications. These techniques rely on lightweight cryptographic algorithms for confidential information exchange. Lightweight algorithms are suitable for use in resource constrained environments such as the Internet of Things where implementations require efficient execution, limited access to memory and small code size. Password Authenticated Key Exchange, and Biometric Authenticated Key Exchange protocols based on user knowledge extracted from biometric sensor data, both rely on weak secrets. These secrets are shared between a client and an access controlled server, and used as inputs to Diffie-Hellman key establishment schemes. Diffie-Hellman provides forward secrecy, prevents user credentials from being exposed during identity authentication attempts, and thwarts man-in-the-middle and phishing attacks. This paper describes the operation of these protocols using an adaptive knowledge substitution process that frequently modifies the weak secrets used for protocol operation without requiring disruptive user password changes. The password substitution strings used to implement this process can be far longer and more complex than the weak secrets people can easily memorize. The process described in this paper allows people with diverse abilities to use simple, easily recalled, quickly entered passwords and still benefit from the strength of long, complex strings when operating cryptographic protocols.",

Energy efficient key agreement schemes (KAS) that establish symmetric secrets are best suited for resource constraint devices of low cost Internet of Things (IoT), like sensors of Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN). There exists numerous elegant distributed KAS, either random or deterministic; however an adequate deterministic hierarchical proposal is absent till date. We propose a lightweight key agreement scheme (KAS) that achieves these desirable design criteria:                                          supports a decentralized hierarchy of prefixed number of levels (l).

abstract="This paper presents a lightweight anti-counterfeiting solution using intrinsic Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs), which are already embedded in most commodity hardware platforms. The presented solution is particularly suitable for low-end computing devices without on-board security features. Our anti-counterfeiting approach is based on extracting a unique fingerprint for individual devices exploiting inherent PUF characteristics from the on-chip static random-access memory (SRAM), which in turn allows to bind software to a particular hardware platform. Our solution does not require additional hardware, making it flexible as well as cost efficient. In a first step, we statistically analyze the characteristics of the intrinsic PUF instances found in two device types, both based on a widely used ARM Cortex-M microcontroller. We show that the quality of the PUF characteristics is almost ideal. Subsequently, we propose a security architecture to protect the platform's firmware by using a modified boot loader. In a proof of concept, we embed our solution on a state-of-the-art commodity system-on-a-chip platform equipped with an MCU similar to the ones previously analyzed.",

Each house includes a microgeneration system based on the use of sustainable energy. In theoretical conditions, the design is capable of satisfying entirely its energy needs. However in real conditions there are situations in which it is necessary more energy, and others on the contrary, it produces more energy than necessary. This paper proposes the use of context-aware paradigm that integrate ubiquitous sensor network for the optimization of the energy resource available. The goal is to achieve the maximum energy efficiency during the distribution, in real time and according to energy demand in housings and community equipments. Using context-aware paradigm the system obtains environmental information, determines the profile of consumption of the users and calculates the instantaneous energy needs. This information is obtained from ubiquitous networks and will be used by systems of distribution of the electrical grid of the group of housings. Different paradigms of communication are used that provides the necessary support to achieve near real time. These paradigms are based on the protocols used in the development of the Internet of things.",

abstract="Access control policy management is an increasingly hard problem from both the security point of view and the verification point of view. SELinux is a Linux Security Module (LSM) implementing a mandatory access control mechanism. SELinux integrates user identity, roles, and type security attributes for stating rules in security policies. As SELinux policies are developed and maintained by security administrators, they often become quite complex, and it is important to carefully analyze them in order to have high assurance of their correctness. There are many existing analysis tools for modeling and analyzing SELinux policies with the goal of answering specific safety and functionality questions. In this paper, we identify and highlight current gaps in these existing tools for SELinux policy analysis, and propose new tools and technologies with the potential to lead to significant improvements. The proposed solution includes adopting a certified access control policy language such as ACCPL (A Certified Access Core Policy Language). ACCPL comes with formal proofs of important properties, and our proposed solution includes adopting it to facilitate various analyses and proof of reasonability properties. ACCPL is general, and our goal is to design a certified domain-specific policy language based on it, specialized to our task.",

Indeed, there is no way for occupants to specify their preferences to HVAC system. This paper proposes an innovation in the management of HVAC systems: a system that tracks the occupants preferences, and manages automatically the ventilation and heating levels accordingly to their preferences, allowing the system to pool its resources to saving energy while maintaining user comfort levels. A prototype solution implementation is described and evaluated by simulation using occupants' votes. Our findings indicate that one of the algorithms is able to successfully maintain the appropriate comfort levels while also reducing energy consumption by comparing with a standard scenario.",

This paper analyzes classical approach of definition of the retransmission timeout (RTO) estimate, proposed in RFC 6298, and compares it with the Eifel Retransmission Timer and the new ideas proposed in CoCoAP. Finally, we present our method for calculating RTO. Our approach could be seen as an extension of the classical TCP algorithm, where instead of constants that are used to take into account history of the current state we use a dynamically changing parameter. The value of this parameter is defined as a ratio between current sample of the round-trip time (RTT) and the RTO value.",

abstract="Mobile wireless sensor networks (MWSN) are most popular for new generation of sensor networks. Now a days' many applications such as health monitoring, environment monitoring or surveillance, the performance of MWSNs are much more versatile than WSNs. Some protocols from MANET such as AODV, DSR and GPSR are able to work on this environment. This manuscript has focused on two major issues. Firstly, formulating an energy-aware selective stable single-path routing protocol for MWSNs that is pertinent to the present challenges of the researchers. Secondly, presenting a germane architecture that can accumulate the data and synchronize with cloud database at periodic interval in order to predict about ominous situation. Coda of the manuscript presents the simulation result of our proposed algorithm and behavioural analysis of successful packet delivery from source to sink node with respect to node density and node mobility condition. Our proposed single-path selection methodology ameliorates the overall network lifetime in case of high network traffic.",

abstract="Users who request to access protected objects must obtain the authorization of access control systems. Among the elements of decision for such systems should be the risk of authorizing accesses under various assumptions, and one of the notions of risk is threat likelihood. Access control systems deals essentially with insider threats coming from people within the organization, such as employees, business associates or contractors, who could violate access control policies. We present in this paper a new approach for insider threat likelihood assessment for secrecy and integrity properties by considering reading and writing operations within the context of access control systems. Access operations, the trustworthiness of subjects, the sensitivity of objects, and the applied security countermeasures are all considered in the assessment of the likelihood of this category of insider threats. Both qualitative and quantitative assessments are provided. Hence our approach makes it possible to compare and calculate the likelihoods of these insider threats, leading to more flexible and more informed access control decisions in various situations.",

abstract="Situation-aware service is recognized as an emerging research issue in ubiquitous computing. It becomes more important and significant with the recent progress in IoT (Internet of Things), since the situations considered in IoT are more complex, become global, and cause more conflict. In this paper, a middleware for management conflict situations was designed, to prompt the development of context-aware services. It is characterized by its ability of situation-oriented, paying attention to relations among users (and situations as well) and smart objects around. Eventually, following issues were solved: (a) a method for detecting (i.e., being aware of) a specific situation, and triggering corresponding service; and (b) an algorithm for conflict situations/contexts management. A diagram of situation state transition (DSST) was proposed to specify states of a situation. A set of situation-oriented ECA rules are presented to reason the situations' states based on sensed data. Policies based on DSST for resolving conflicts were also given. The experiment results demonstrate the feasibility of proposed method, and the performance of proposed situation-oriented policies.",

abstract="In the past two decades, the development of payment solutions has significantly changed the way online retail businesses are conducted and enlarged the scope of numerous payment technologies offered in the market. Despite the multitude of payment solutions, card-based systems are still the most prevalent. While secure, card-based systems still lack privacy protection, user control and supervision. In this paper, we propose a new e-payment framework relying on card-based payment systems, with the aggregation of virtual credit cards and a personalized conditional E-Payment Plan defined by the cardholder. In our framework, the cardholder's privacy is ensured with the use of Virtual Credit Cards. Moreover, with the E-Payment Plan Service Manager (E-PPSM), our proposed framework brings considerable improvements to the shopping practice. Through this service, cardholders can efficiently control and supervise their online purchases. The proposed framework thus ensures three considerable concentrations: personalization, control, and supervision applicable in multi-purchase checkouts, which are, in addition to privacy protection, our main contributions.",

abstract="Data collection is one of the fundamental functions in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Different from traditional data collection mechanisms which only consider a single and stationary sink, this paper studies this problem in a scenario with multiple mobile sinks. The motivation is for a WSN to support future applications, such as Internet of Things (IoT). In this case, a WSN is required to be able to deliver sensing results to multiple users moving around the network. There are two difficulties in this problem: sink mobility and multiple sinks. Since sinks are mobile, data delivery paths need to be updated frequently, which causes huge maintenance cost. To resolve this problem, we propose a hop-count based data collection architecture together with an efficient mobility management scheme. On the other side, sensing results from a large number of sensors are sent to multiple sinks, which causes lots of packet transmissions. To resolve this problem, we combine the idea of multicast and data aggregation. We first prove that the optimal multicast decision is a NP-hard problem and then propose a distributed heuristic solution. In addition, we further integrate data aggregation into multicast and propose a distributed many-to-many aggregation mechanism. Simulations are constructed to show the efficiency of the proposed schemes. The results show that both our multicast method and many-to-many aggregation method can efficiently reduce communication cost when delivering data to multiple mobile sinks.",

abstract="Building Information Modeling (BIM) has been implemented in construction projects to overcome problems such as project delay, cost overrun and poor quality of project. BIM enhances construction player to perform their activities in effective and efficient through the development of three dimensional (3D) model. However, BIM requires changes in current practices among construction players in terms of the processes and technology that use for managing projects. Therefore, this paper is aimed to discuss on roles and responsibilities of construction players in projects using BIM. This is a review paper that discusses on BIM, its definition, activities with roles and responsibilities of construction players in managing projects. The findings revealed that roles and responsibilities of construction players in projects using BIM are differ from conventional practice by the use of BIM tool. The findings of this paper provide useful information for construction players that considering implementing BIM in projects.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) and sensor networks are improving the cooperation between organizations, becoming more efficient and productive for the industrial systems. However, high iteration between human, machines, and heterogeneous IoT technologies increases the security threats. The IoT security is an essential requirement to fully adoption of applications, which requires correct management of information and confidentiality. The system and devices' variability requires dynamically adaptive systems to provide services depending on the context of the environment. In this paper, we propose a model driven adaptive approach to offer security services for an ontology-based security framework. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach allows creating secure capabilities more efficient with the generation of security services based on security requirements in the knowledge base (IoTSec ontology). An industrial scenario of C2NET project was analyzed to identify the transformation of a system design of security solution in a platform specific model.",

abstract="Today with the growing number of vehicles in the metropolitan cities, there is high demand for a smart parking management system. When people reach their destination, searching for a parking slot to park their vehicle itself creates lots of traffic congestion in the parking lot/roads taking their precious time. Hence there is a need for a smart parking management system assisting the users with the information about the availability of free parking slots at the entrance of the places like malls, organizations etc. they visit for avoiding congestion, irritation and tension. The proposed solution system in this paper tries to resolve this by detecting the available slots for parking in the parking area using IoT technologies and displaying the same on a webpage/display for user's kind reference. This system also provisions the users to book the free parking slot soon after entering the parking area thus solves the internal congestion inside the parking lot, saves their valuable time and relieves people from tension.",

This statement is widely acknowledged in published literature. However, according to some academics, tacit knowledge is derived from a person's lifetime of experience, practice, perception and learning, which makes it hard to capture and document in order to be shared. This project investigates if social media tools can be used to improve and enable tacit knowledge sharing within a global engineering enterprise. This paper first provides a brief background of the subject area, followed by an explanation of the industrial investigation, from which the proposed knowledge framework to improve tacit knowledge sharing is presented.

Existing software allows two options for performing experiments: (1) Interacting with the graphic user interface (it is intuitive and close to reality, but it has certain constraints that cannot be easily solved), or (2) scripting algorithms (it allows more complex instructions, however, users have to handle a programming language). This paper presents the definition and implementation of a generic experimentation language for conducting automatic experiments on existing online laboratories. The main objective is to use an existing online lab, created independently, as a tool in which users can perform tailored experiments. To achieve it, authors present the Experiment Application. Not only unifies the two conceptions of performing experiments; it also allows the user to define algorithms for interactive laboratories in a simple way without the disadvantages of the traditional programming languages. It is composed by Blockly, to define and design the experiments, and Google Chart, to analyze and visualize the experiment results. This tool offers benefits to students, teachers and, even, lab designers. For the moment, it can be used with any existing lab or simulation created with the authoring tool Easy Java(script) Simulations. Since there are hundreds of labs created with this tool, the potential applicability of the tool is considerable. To illustrate its utility a very well-known system is used: the water tank system.",

abstract="The digitization of manufacturing through the introduction of Industrie 4.0 technologies creates additional business opportunities and technical challenges. The integration of such technologies on legacy production machinery can upgrade them to become part of the digital and smart manufacturing environment. A typical example is that of industrial monitoring and maintenance, which can benefit from internet of things (IoT) solutions. This paper presents the development of an-IoT-enabled monitoring solution for machine tools as part of a remote maintenance approach. While the technical challenges pertaining to the development and integration of such solutions in a manufacturing environment have been the subject of relevant research in the literature, the corresponding new security challenges arising from the introduction of such technologies have not received equal attention. Failure to adequately handle such issues is a key barrier to the adoption of such solutions by industry. This paper aims to assess and classify the security aspects of integrating IoT technology with monitoring systems in manufacturing environments and propose a systematic view of relevant vulnerabilities and threats by taking an IoT architecture point of view. Our analysis has led to proposing a novel modular approach for secure IoT-enabled monitoring for legacy production machinery. The introduced approach is implemented on a case study of machine tool monitoring, highlighting key findings and issues for further research.",

abstract="Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are a new shaking development in higher education. They combine openness and scalability in a most energetic way. They have the capacity to broaden participation in higher education. In this way, they help to achieve social inclusion, the dissemination of knowledge and pedagogical innovation and also the internationalization of higher education institutions. However, one of the most essential elements for a massive open language learning experience to be efficient is to enhance learners and to facilitate networked learning experiences. In fact, MOOCs are meant to serve an undefined number of participants, thus serving a high heterogeneity of profiles, with various learning styles and schemata, and also contexts of contribution and diversity of online platforms. Personalization can play a primary role in this process. Accordingly, adaptive MOOCs use adaptive techniques so as to present personalized learning experiences, having as basis dynamic assessment and data collecting on the course. They count on networks of prerequisites and deal with learners according to their different personalized paths through the content. This has been described by the Gates Foundation as an essential novelty in the area for large-scale productivity in online courses. Analytics are also to be credited with bringing about change and improvement of the course in the future. This paper looks into the MOOCs system by reviewing the available literature, spotting the various limitations of traditional MOOC system and suggesting a proposed framework for adaptive MOOCs based on hybrid techniques. By so doing, we generate suggestions of learning paths adapted to the competences profile of each participant with a focus on objectives, such as reducing the rate of dropout and improving MOOCs quality.",

abstract="In this paper we develop and test a distributed algorithm providing Energy Consumption Schedules (ECS) in smart grids for a residential district. The goal is to achieve a given aggregate load profile. The NP-hard constrained optimization problem reduces to a distributed unconstrained formulation by means of Lagrangian Relaxation technique, and a meta-heuristic algorithm based on a Quantum inspired Particle Swarm with L{\'e}vy flights. A centralized iterative reputation-reward mechanism is proposed for end-users to cooperate to avoid power peaks and reduce global overload, based on random distributions simulating human behaviors and penalties on the effective ECS differing from the suggested ECS. Numerical results show the protocols effectiveness.",

abstract="The transformation to service economy calls for the development of Industrial Product Service Systems (IPS2), which has changed traditional business models greatly. In recent years, there are trends and needs from the industry to further develop IPS2 by integrating advanced information technologies. While the emergence of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) provides whole new viewpoints and approaches for IPS2 construction, there are still no public recognized systematic solutions. To solve this problem, the concept of intelligent IPS2 and a framework integrating IPS2 with CPS is proposed in this work. The system decomposition and intellectualization process of intelligent IPS2 are analyzed, trying to figure out the interaction mechanisms between IPS2 and CPS. Then A general architecture of CPS supported intellectualization of IPS2 is developed, which is constructed by five layers. The model for intelligent IPS2 is put forward based on industry investigation, trying to offer possible guidelines and roadmap for those service transforming companies.",

The eligibility of players for participating in the main game phase is restricted among those ranked relatively high in the invitational phase.

History taking from patients represents a crucial phase for physicians in order to evaluate the patient's wellness status and to perform correct diagnoses. As a routine procedure, it is a time-consuming and not so appealing obligation. In this paper we present a smart approach to anamnesis in order to gain as much data as possible and to have high quality information by avoiding any misunderstandings or errors. The approach is mainly based on the possibility to capture data directly at the source increasing the overall effectiveness of physician's time and of the visit itself.

abstract="Ambient assisted living (AAL) platforms are seen as a viable way for managing healthcare costs in an ever aging first world population. One of the most crucial parts of AAL development is the integration of the different developed components to a functional cohesive platform. Integration strategies are many and varied catering to different system needs. The USEFIL AAL system was conceived as a platform utilizing low cost ``off-the-shelf'' technology and providing an independent and healthy lifestyle to elderly people. This platform like several AAL platforms reached its system integration stage consisting of relatively few components. In that context technological hurdles have been resolved in the development process of each component. For that reason in the present work the focus is on relatively simple but crucial ``observations from the field'' taken during the USEFIL AAL platform's integration effort. The resulting guidelines for integration of AAL platforms are: A) Managerial clarity: Clearly defined roles both cross and within teams, robust avenues of interpersonal communication, detailed and flexible fiscal planning. B) Testing diligence: No assumptions should be made about the robustness of components or the triviality of tests. Component interconnection may lead to unexpected loss of functionality. C) Iterative functional testing: In the case of AAL systems with complex AI components the introduction of additional infrastructure may lead to significant differentiation in functionality a thing that needs to be tested and corrected if detected. D) Pre-pilot testing objectivity: Pre pilot users testing the AAL platform should be provided with minimal training in order to interact with the system as an ordinary user. Only that way they can provide genuinely original feedback. These guidelines while non-technical proved essential for the integration of USEFIL and could serve as a primer for avoiding pitfalls in the integration of similar AAL systems.",

abstract="Big Data is a massive set of data that is so complex to be managed by traditional applications. Nowadays, it includes huge, complex, and abundant structured, semi-structure, and unstructured data as well as hidden data that are generated and gathered from several fields and resources. The challenges for managing Big Data include extracting, analyzing, visualizing, sharing, storage, transferring and searching such data. Currently, the traditional data processing tools and its applications are not capable of managing such revolutionized data. Therefore, there is a critical need to develop effective and efficient Big Data Mining techniques. This, in turn, has opened opportunities for research frontiers by using the exploiting artificial intelligence techniques for Big Data management. This study investigates the most effective Big Data Mining techniques and their rationale applications in various social, medical and scientific fields.",

abstract="Object Identifier (OID) has been used in various areas, but its usage has been limited to naming things for a long time. In order to extend OID for identifying Web services, we suggested a new kind of OID named Service OID and its relevant resolution scheme. It is expected for devices to easily collaborate by resolving a simple number-shaped Service OID to the corresponding URI. This simple resolution seems straightforward, but it is not enough for a caller to use the converted URI because every URI needs its unique parameter signature. For this, in the proposed resolution scheme, a data schema was designed and used to provide the binding information of URI.",

abstract="Maintenance of assembly and manufacturing equipment is crucial to ensure productivity, product quality, on-time delivery, and a safe working environment. Predictive Maintenance approach utilizes the condition monitoring (CM) data to predict the future machine conditions and makes decisions upon this prediction. Recent development in CM leads to context aware approach where in parallel with CM measurements also data and information related to the context are gathered. Context could be operational condition, history of machine usage and performed maintenance actions. In general more obtained information gives better accuracy of prediction. It is important to track operational context in dynamically changing environment. Today in manufacturing we can observe shift from mass production to mass customisation. This leads to changes from long series of identical products to short series of different variants. Therefore implies changing operational conditions for manufacturing equipment. Moreover, where asset consist of multiple identical or similar equipment the context aware method can be used to combine in reliable way information. This should allow to increase accuracy of prediction for population as a whole as well as for each equipment instances. Same of those data have been already recorded and stored in industrial IT systems. However, it is distributed over different IT systems that are used by different functional units (e.g. maintenance department, production department, quality department, tooling department etc.). This paper is a conceptual paper based on initial research work and investigation in two manufacturing companies from automotive industry.",

abstract="Persuasive technologies are gaining ground. As they enter into society they are being applied in more situations, and integrated with other technologies in increasingly smart environments. We argue that this development creates new challenges in designing ethically responsible persuasive technologies. Applications in social contexts like work environments raise the questions whether persuasion serves the interests of the user or the employer, and whether users can still voluntarily choose to use the technology. Informing the user and obtaining consent become complicated when persuasive systems are integrated in smart environments. To ensure that the autonomy of the user is respected, we argue that the user and provider should agree on the goal of persuasion, and users should be informed about persuasion in smart environments.",

abstract="Normally, households comprise of people and their material possessions, where persons exercise exclusive agency. The digital augmentation of domestic environment transforms the constitution of households, populating them with new types of entities, namely connected and `smart' objects/devices and distributed services. These new ``players'' operating within the household, are complex in nature, responsive, adaptive, blurring the given distinction between household members and their stuff, and evading a simplified classification. We consider the augmented home environment as an ecosystem which humans occupy among other interacting entities or parties which are actively affiliated to other networks and environments. Starting with the premise that a household inventory is one way to formally describe and define the household, we examine the contents and structure of traditional home inventories, and then elaborate on the potential evolution of the augmented home inventories as new types of interacting entities are introduced. Thus, we observe a shift from static and place-bound to dynamic classifications, allowing for diverse groupings of home-stuff. We contemplate on the possibility of integrating all parts of the household ecosystem into one unified classification and ontological system. We, also, acknowledge that the exponential growth of IoT will put increasing pressure for managing the huge volumes of data generated from connected households, on which an effective, meaningful, and socially compatible classification system is required. Finally, we highlight several challenges to the augmented home inventory.",

abstract="This paper presents an internet of thing (IoT)-based innovative real-time pH monitoring and control of municipal wastewater for agriculture and gardening application. During the past few decades after the green revolution in India, water requirement is increased exponentially in all sectors, viz., agriculture, gardening, industry, etc. The demand and supply relationship is very essential for every country in present time, and is also a big challenge to satisfy this requirement around the world. Regular change in the climate and the urbanization makes the lavish use of the available resources has exhausted the available resources. Water is necessary for the survival of the human being on the earth. So for the survival the conservation and management of the available water resource are also equally important. Moreover, for the healthier society, the access of the clean and safe water resource is also imperative. Nowadays municipal wastewater is recycled and reused for agriculture and gardening application after treatment. This paper describes a smart solution to control the water quality through its pH, thus to treat the municipal wastewater and its reuse in the agriculture and gardening purpose. The idea is to develop a low-cost electronic system and its application with such a quality of maintaining (monitoring and control) the water quality within the prescribed standard.",

The data collection merits for normal edge operations but limits for the handling of anomaly events and prediction of prognostics conditions. In this paper, we propose an innovative machine learning edge approach that extends Kalman filter for anomaly detection so as to (a) allow the edge to adaptively collect granular data when abnormal or anomaly data markers witnessed for prognostics and (b) relaxes the data collection frequency for normal device operation cycles. In summary, the adaptive edge analytics fine-tunes the data collection and analysis so that overall health and longevity of the device can be improved.

abstract="The internet of things (IoT) is the challenging key to making any system to be smart. Real-time operating systems (RTOS) are used for meeting the real-time requirements for the real-time systems; this makes the IoT applications have the RTOS features like reliability. There are many IoT Platforms have been created, but the most of them are done for specific applications and don't handle the real-time constraints of the real-time systems. In this paper, a design and implementation for an IoT Platform will be proposed for general applications, especially the critical applications for the real-time systems. Also, Many Communication Protocols are used in the IoT Platforms as the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol, but many of them don't support the Multi-Topic Messaging. In this paper a simple communication protocol will be presented, it enhances the delay and the traffic needed for the multi-topic messaging by supporting the multi-topic feature, a performance analysis for the proposed protocol versus the MQTT will be studied.",

abstract="Cognitive and physical functions gradually decline because of aging. To support healthy and safe living of elderly individuals, a system that can monitor their activities of daily living is needed. This paper proposes a handrail-shaped sensor as a new Internet of Things (IoT)-type sensing system for long-term monitoring of the mobility of elderly people. The handrail-shaped sensor detects changes in mobility using information on movement velocity and the degree of dependence on the handrail. To evaluate the effectiveness of the sensor, we first assessed the accuracy of estimating the position of the load applied to the handrail in our laboratory. We then field-tested the handrail sensor in the home of an 88-year-old woman. The experimental results show that the handrail sensor can estimate the walking speed as well as the grasping position of an elderly person in an actual daily living environment.",

abstract="Regarding the pressing social concerns of well-being and aging society, this paper explores the potentials of a smart indoor gardening system that links gardening activities and the IoT technology. The benefits of gardening have been emphasized to improve the quality of life. However, a number of reasons due to a lack of gardening culture and apartment housing systems limit personal gardening in Korea. Thus, indoor gardening has been paid attention as an alternative, but it is still a challenge. Previous studies and practices have shown that the IoT technology can be applied to numerous occasions, and can feasibly provide a solution to these gardening issues. This paper proposes a possible smart indoor gardening system to cope with the issues.",

Our novel idea of using an IoT framework known as GDP (Global Data Plane) integrated with blockchain helps in communication and management of data between untrusted parties. The blockchain maintains an immutable record of drugs each party holds and transactions the parties make amongst themselves. This makes it hard to introduce counterfeit drugs into the supply chain.",

abstract="Since frequent accidents such as bridge collapses have drawn much attention, structural health monitoring (SHM) is considered as a research hotspot in both academic and engineering fields. With the development of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), a large number of sensors have been equipped on architectural or mechanical structures to acquire real-time state data that may imply their health problems, which indicates that data processing is of great significance in WSN-based SHM. In this paper, we propose a SHM scheme by using RealAdaBoost algorithm in a WSN-based environment, in which the RealAdaBoost algorithm is employed here for data classification so as to detect and locate damages of the bridge. Simulation results indicate that the proposed RealAdaBoost algorithm provides better performance than several existing ones employed in SHM scenarios.",

It underlies all recent trends, including the Internet of Services, cloud computing, and Future Internet. However, to turn the promise of this principle into realised benefits, services must be accompanied by exact definitions as to the conditions of their usage. These conditions can be specified by Service Level Agreements (SLAs).

This chapter introduces the underlying motivation for SLA management, exhibits the vision of the SLA@SOI project, and relates this vision to other key management approaches.",

abstract="While the Internet of things (IoT) promises to improve areas such as energy efficiency, health care, and transportation, it is highly vulnerable to cyberattacks. In particular, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks overload the bandwidth of a server. But many IoT devices form part of cyber-physical systems (CPS). Therefore, they can be used to launch ``physical'' denial-of-service attacks (PDoS) in which IoT devices overflow the ``physical bandwidth'' of a CPS. In this paper, we quantify the population-based risk to a group of IoT devices targeted by malware for a PDoS attack. In order to model the recruitment of bots, we develop a ``Poisson signaling game,'' a signaling game with an unknown number of receivers, which have varying abilities to detect deception. Then we use a version of this game to analyze two mechanisms (legal and economic) to deter botnet recruitment. Equilibrium results indicate that (1) defenders can bound botnet activity, and (2) legislating a minimum level of security has only a limited effect, while incentivizing active defense can decrease botnet activity arbitrarily. This work provides a quantitative foundation for proactive PDoS defense.",

abstract="This paper describes the design of a new system architecture for monitoring and controlling purposes of a group of sensors and actuators within a wireless sensor network (WSN). This system can manage an undefined amount of clustered networks. The proposed system architecture enables Internet communications to reach the WSN in a highly efficient way. This structure reduces the bottleneck of the Internet/WSN bridge and the amount of messages inside the WSN when an Internet request arrives. Besides, each individual WSN implements an Intelligent Rule-Based System Automation (IRBSA) that performs the automation of the behaviour of the network motes according to the previously included rules. These rules describe the actions that are executed when all the conditions of that rule are met. Opposite to traditional approaches, IRBSA is placed in the WSN Header Mote rather than in the Internet server or in every mote.",

abstract="Our interest in this paper is to understand the interplay between large technological programs and smaller innovation projects, i.e. how a small project may enter and change the larger structure. In our e-health context we conceptualise this as the interplay between heavyweight and lightweight IT. Our research questions are, how does an innovation initiative develop within an established information infrastructure, and how can we overcome the barriers for interplay between heavyweight and lightweight technologies? Our empirical evidence is a case study in the health care sector in Norway, where we investigated a mega-program called Digital Renewal, and a small lightweight initiative called Medicloud. The theoretical lens was actor-network theory and we offer two insights. First, we identify a set of barriers for fruitful interplay between heavyweight and lightweight IT. Second, we show that these barriers may be overcome by a careful combination of technical and organisational solutions, in order to stabilise a new network as a part of the larger information infrastructure.",

abstract="To meet the needs related to detecting dust, this paper describes a system based on ZigBee communication technology, which allows for smart real-time monitoring of the concentrations of dust in system fields. The system is mainly composed of a particulate matter sensor module, data acquisition and processing module, and a ZigBee communication module. ZigBee communication technology replaces traditional monitoring systems that transmit data by wired cable or via a mobile communication base station. The particulate-matter-detecting sensor uses a PD4NS dust sensor based on the principles of photoelectricity and particle counting. It can detect particles whose size is greater than 1Â $\mu$m. Its maximum detection range is up to 8,000 pcs/283Â mL with measured results at Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Currently, the system obtains signals sampled by the PD4NS dust sensor and handled by a microcontrol unit (MCU) and then data are sent to the monitoring center (PC) via a ZigBee communication network. The system can be applied to similar monitor systems based on the Internet of Things because of its simple structure, low cost, and high movability.",

abstract="Key management is an essential functionality for developing secure cryptosystems; particularly for implementations to low cost devices of a Distributed Sensor Networks (DSN)--a prototype of Internet of Things (IoT). Low cost leads to constraints in various resources of constituent devices of a IoT (e.g., sensors of a DSN); thereby restricting implementations of computationally heavy public key cryptosystems. This leads to adaptation of the novel key predistribution trick in symmetric key platform to efficiently tackle the problem of key management for these resource starved networks. After a few initial proposals based on random graphs, most key predistribution schemes (KPS) use deterministic (combinatorial) approaches to assure essential design properties. Combinatorial designs like a                                                                                   {\$}{\$}(v,b,r,k)-{\$}{\$}                  configuration which forms a                                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}mu (v,b,r,k)-{\$}{\$}                  CID are effective schemes to design KPSÂ [20]. In this paper, we use bent Boolean functions to generate four combinatorial designs for the purpose of designing deterministic KPS. Of particular interest are our later (two) schemes that are constructed over Dillon's bent Boolean function. Effectiveness of our solutions in term of crucial metrics in comparison to prominent schemes has been theoretically established.",

The research domain of smarter cities aims to monitor disruptive events (e.g., emergencies, Olympics), analyze social behaviour, identify citizens' sentiment and understand their interactions with services. On the other side, cities can use their understanding of the citizen to foster stronger relationships with the diverse communities in their constituencies. This understanding could be applied to mobilize people on important issues such as education, health care, political engagement and community awareness. Also, new digital fabrication tools have been recently used to generate adoptable, dynamic and interactive architecture able to evolve together with urban dwellers, and it has been shown that new Internet-of-Things devices could effectively capture physical observations to understand how cities and urban centers work.

The architecture puts the training process and model repository in cloud platforms, and the recognition process and data gathering in mobile devices. The communication is carried out via Git protocol to ensure the success of data transmission in unstable network environments. We used smart car camera that can detect objects in recorded videos during driving as an example application, and implemented the system on NVIDIA Jetson TK1. Experimental results show that detection rate can achieve four frame-per-second with Faster R-CNN and ZF model, and the system can work well even when the network connection is unstable.

It is a wrong perception viewed by many of them. The concept `Smart' is generic. It relates with multidimensional aspects. Before entering into systems design for Smart manufacturing as a curriculum to our Indian students, we must understand the objectives and roles of current trends in manufacturing first.Â Next, evolutionary systems design of this curriculum will bring social benefits on imparting smart manufacturing to our students. This curriculum brings into a large attention from academics and practitioners of how to best design implement and manage ``novelty in manufacturing''.

These emerging Big Data applications present enterprises with very high data-to-compute ratio. For example, in Square Kilometre Array (SKA), a telescope generates more data than the whole Internet with a single file often reaching multiple terabytes in size. As data volumes continue to increase exponentially, the challenge is not only how to store and manage data but also to effectively analyse the data to gain insight knowledge to make smarter decisions. One of the key challenges is transforming the raw data available to your business into business value and strategic advantage. The better management and analysis of Big Data will become the next frontier of innovation, competition and productivity. For example, according to a McKinsey Global Institute study, a retailer exploiting the full potential of big data could increase its operating margin by more than 60 percent; efficient and effective use of big data could save more than {\$}300 billion dollars for US government in healthcare alone.

This new paradigm has brought new research challenges, such as the need for a novel framework intended to controlling and, more in general, facilitating the interaction among the heterogeneous devices conforming the environment at the edge of the network and the available resources at cloud. A key feature that this framework should meet is the capability of uniquely and unequivocally identify the connected devices. In this paper a hash-based naming strategy suitable to be used in the F2C environment is presented. The proposed naming method is based on three main components: certification, hashing and identification. This research is an ongoing work, thus, the steps to follow since a device connects to the F2C network until it receives a name are described and the major challenges that must be solved are analyzed.",

Billions of smart devices are being implemented - from smart TVs and cars to other smart health monitors and wearable technologies and this resulted in the development of smart interconnected environments. The core vision of the aforementioned smart interconnected environment is the realization of a reliable and secure two way communication between smart devices. However, the high level of heterogeneity, coupled with the wide scale of smart embedded systems, has magnified the security threats. Traditional security countermeasures and privacy cannot be enforced directly on such systems due to their limited computing capabilities and their diverse set of hardware architectures.

abstract="This paper proposes enabling intelligence for cyber-physical system of intelligent collaborating energy storages. Two intelligent batteries coordinate their behaviour in a dynamic electricity price scenario, accumulating the energy when the electricity price is low, and replacing the grid when the price is high. Both batteries directly exchange their state information with each other without any centralized processing agent, following the coordination algorithm developed in this paper. This simplifies their integration and enables achieving more optimal behaviour with regards to state of their charge. When one battery is depleted, the other one immediately compensates the losses by a higher discharge rate. Such a distributed coordination approach enables plug-and-play formation of system of batteries, demonstrates the efficiency of such formation and allows for reduction of costs due to longer discharge time of the batteries.",

abstract="Software-as-a-service (SaaS) is a very successful model for providing cloud-based services over the internet. However, due to the dynamic nature of SaaS services, it becomes very challenging to ensure provision of scalability, applying frequent maintenance and functionality updates to SaaS Services. SOAP and REST are the two mostly used software architectural styles for accessing and consuming SaaS services in cloud environment and each have its distinct advantages. Therefore, to address above mentioned challenges, it is critical to choose the suitable architectural style because the success of a SaaS is strongly coupled with its architecture style. Choosing the right software architecture for a system is a multi-criteria decision making problem and it takes into consideration the architectural style characteristics, non-functional requirements and working domain requirements. In this paper, we propose a rule-based multi-criteria decision support system (DSS) for a SaaS application architecture selection. Our proposed DSS uses weighted sum model (WSM) that take into account the architectural style characteristics, non-functional and domain specific requirements.",

To create awareness among people, internet of things (IoT) and wearable sensors through wireless sensor networks (WSN) can be used to facilitate this task. Deployment of such sensors in remote water sources to detect the water quality is made through WSN.

Tourism and Hospitality Management 18, no. 1 (2012): 37--53) with consumers is critical to win consumer spending and long-term brand loyalty [1]. Brands want their customers to be in pleasing subliminal scented (Robert Klara, ``Something in the air,''                   http://www.adweek.com/brandmarketing/something-air-138683/                                   creation date: March 2012, access date: January 02, 2017) environments because, as research has shown, even a few microparticles of scent can do a lot of marketing's heavy lifting, from improving consumer perceptions of quality to increasing the number of store visits. Hence, customer venues such as hotels, retail showrooms, casinos, hospitable and other captive audience places employ HVAC (Heating, ventilation and air conditioning) based scent diffusion system that delivers a seamless olfactory [2] experience to connect with consumers on a deeper emotional level, resulting in a more memorable experience. Current scent diffusion systems, however, use power hungry deployments and dispense periodically, without accounting social mood, geographic local etiquettes, venue-patron occupancy ratios and sudden changes in foot traffic numbers. Thus, resulting sub-optimal user experience that might lead to a poor brand engagement and could incur higher operational costs and thus reduce over all return on the investment (ROI). In this research paper, we propose an innovative approach to create artificial intelligence (AI) infused Fragrance Systems that improve venue experience and operational efficiencies through the application of data science, Big Data Technologies, Edge processing, Supervised machine learning and IoT Sensing. Our system combines pragmatic data science and machine learning algorithms with arty social and mood drivers, albeit data science computed, to create adaptive and artistic fragrance system. The amalgamation data science with human mood influencers is our formula to the innovation that we propose and present a prototyping solution design as well as its application and certain experimental results.",

The collected data on the basis of threat's priority is used to decide whether to stop the train or let the train move. Whole critical machinery will be having their local error detection and correction mechanisms through sensors and transducers.

abstract="In the big data protecting technologies, most of the existing data protections adopt entire encryption that leads to the researches of lightweight encryption algorithms, without considering from the protected data itself. In our previous paper (FGEM), it finds that not all the parts of a data need protections, the entire data protection can be supplanted as long as the critical parts of the structured data are protected. Reducing unnecessary encryption makes great sense for raising efficiency in big data processing. In this paper, the improvement of FGEM makes it suitable to protect semi-structured and unstructured data efficiently. By storing semi-structured and unstructured datum in an improved tree structure, the improved FGEM for the datum is achieved by getting congener nodes. The experiments show the improved FGEM has short operating time and low memory consumption.",

abstract="Air Traffic Management (ATM) systems represent essential infrastructure that is critical for flight safety. Communication is a key element in the present ATM system. Communication between air traffic controllers and pilots remains a vital part of air traffic control operations, and communication problems can result in hazardous situations. ATM modernization requests for a paradigm shift away from voice towards digital data communications. In the paper the reliability of ATM voice communication system (VCS) on the base of embedded cloud technology is discussed. Mathematical model of the channel reliability in the ATM communication network based on embedded cloud technology in the real conditions of operation is developed. On the base of developed model the boundary value of reliability parameters for automatics of VCS embedded cloud in different failure modes is analyzed.",

abstract="This paper considers classification of diverse traffic types in Internet of Things (IoT) based on importance of data rate, packet size and proposes a priority-based probabilistic packet scheduling strategy for efficient packet transmission. Reduction of peak resource usage, dynamic control of service rate corresponding to arrival rate and QoS buffer management are few main factors considered to develop this strategy. By calculating percentage of link bandwidth required for prioritized traffic in each cycle, we provide quality of service (QoS) to real time traffic in IoT and non-IoT applications. Different experiments including MPEG traffic traces and Poisson traffic are conducted to verify the proposed scheduler. Also, performance of scheduler for both IoT and Non-IoT applications is compared for different data rates. We observe that the proposed packet scheduler satisfies QoS requirements for both IoT and non-IoT traffic.",

The study is divided into three parts where different factors are analysed providing an observation of the targeted sector from different perspectives. After having identified the research objectives and the characteristics of the internet providers' sector, the Italian Internet market is described through fundamental parameters such as the analysis of demand, global turnover and the analysis of different methods of access to the network. In the second part, we analyse the technical, economic and financial characteristics of the sector, through the study of fundamental elements such as technological readiness of ISPs and the structure of supply, taking into account operating areas and services provided by companies; the survey provides then a study of the companies' size in order to have a clear market segmentation. The last part provides an analysis of the economic and financial structure exploring companies' efficiency through performance indicators. The final result is a critical analysis of findings from which emerges that medium sized ISPs are more performing in terms of business indicators while policies still seem to be in favour of big operators.",

abstract="There is a significant challenge in smart cities implementations. One challenge is to align smart city strategies with the impact on quality of life. Stakeholders' concerns are multiple and diverse, and there is a high interdependency and heterogeneity of technologies and solutions. To tackle this challenge, researchers have suggested to view cities as enterprises and apply an Enterprise Architecture (EA) approach. This approach specifies core requirements on business, information, and technology domains, which are essential to model architecture components and to establish relations between these domains. Existing smart cities frameworks describe different components and domains. However, the main domain requirements and the relations between them are still missing. This paper identifies essential requirements of enterprise architecture in smart cities. These requirements will be used to review and compare current smart city frameworks.",

In this work, we present an IoT-Based E-Learning testbed using Raspberry Pi mounted on Raspbian. We carried out some experiments with a student of our laboratory for brain waves and, encryption and decryption time of cipher algorithms. We used MindWave Mobile (MWM) to get the data. For experimental results, when using our system the concentration is 80 [{\%}] from 0 [s] to 400 [s]. But, for 400 [s] to 1000 [s], concentration is decreased. In the case of not using our system, concentration is almost the same (about 40 [{\%}]) from 0 [s] to 1000 [s]. From simulation results, we found that the decryption time is faster than encryption time, however for 3-DES and Raspberry Pi decryption time is higher than encryption time.",

abstract="The organizations' demand to integrate several disparate data sources and an ever-increasing amount of data is intensifying the occurrence of data quality problems. Currently, data cleaning approaches are tailored for data sources having different schemas but sharing the same data model (e.g. relational model), and are highly dependent on a domain expert to specify data cleaning operations. This paper presents a novel and generic data cleaning methodology aiming to assist the domain expert during the specification of data cleaning operations through reusing knowledge previously expressed for other data sources even if those sources have different data models and/or schemas. This is achieved by abstracting data source models and schemas to a closer human level and by the use of vocabulary to describe the structure and the semantics of data cleaning operations.",

In this paper, a new method is proposed for the better management of the traffic of emergency vehicles through the use of internet of things (IOT). The proposed method enables the emergency vehicles to signal the traffic signal controller placed in the traffic junction regarding their arrival so that the traffic will be regulated.

As a result, several RSP engines have emerged, which are capable of processing semantically annotated data streams on the fly. Performance, correctness and technical soundness of few existing RSP engines have been evaluated in controlled settings using existing benchmarks like LSBench and SRBench. However, these benchmarks focus merely on features of the RSP query languages and engines, and do not consider dynamic application requirements and data-dependent properties such as changes in streaming rate during query execution or changes in application requirements over a period of time. This hinders wide adoption of RSP engines for real-time applications where data properties and application requirements play a key role and need to be characterised in their dynamic setting, such as in the smart city domain.",

abstract="The world population is rapidly aging and becoming a burden to health systems around the world. In this work we present a conceptual framework to encourage the research community to develop more comprehensive and adaptive ICT solutions for prevention and rehabilitation of chronic conditions in the daily life of the aging population and beyond health facilities. We first present an overview of current international standards in human functioning and disability, and how chronic conditions are interconnected in older age. We then describe innovative mobile and sensor technologies, predictive data analysis in healthcare, and game-based prevention and rehabilitation techniques. We then set forth a multidisciplinary approach for the personalized prevention and rehabilitation of chronic conditions using unobtrusive and pervasive sensors, interactive activities, and predictive analytics, which also eases the tasks of health-related researchers, caregivers and providers. Our proposal represents a conceptual basis for future research, in which much remains to be done in terms of standardization of technologies and health terminology, as well as data protection and privacy legislation.",

In order to solve the problem of dissolved oxygen forecast, the prediction model which based on fuzzy neural network has been proposed in this paper. It integrated the characteristic of learning fuzzy logic and neural networks optimized performance to realize the dissolved oxygen prediction.

We have already passed the verge of a paradigm shift where patients are regarded cooperative partners who play an important role in their own care. In the core of this ongoing shift is technology that enables a new kind of service provisioning and digitalization of services. This has created a dilemma; how the patients who are not able (or willing) to use these new services can be reached? To answer this question, a fresh outlook on the roles related to health service provisioning is needed. This examination calls for identification of health technology intermediaries, mediators, who stand at the crossroad of health, care and technology. This exploratory work will look into the intermediary roles, outlining a set of skills and capabilities needed from a mediator.",

abstract="The authors analyze the defects of existent anti-forgery techniques, put forward the idea of applying a lightweight asymmetric identity to fraud guard, and design a drug anti-forgery and tracing system preliminarily. A lightweight asymmetric identity, generated by the optimized REESSE1+ digital signature scheme with an 80-bit modulus, and also called a Board-fingered Identity (BFID), hides the private key of a drug mill, the source information of a drug, and especially the unique number of a drug. A BFID contains only 16 characters with the security of magnitude 2 ^ 80, may be directly printed on the label of a drug concealingly, and does not need to be stored in a chip. The system based on a BFID has effects of anti-forgery, source tracing, and flow-direction tracking, and includes six subsystems: the source information editing subsystem, the key management subsystem, the BFID confection subsystem, the BFID verification subsystem, the source tracing subsystem, and the flow-direction tracking subsystem. When a BFID is verified, it is scratched out, inputted to a mobile phone, and sent to the unified verification platform which works in a cloud computing mode, and is bound to a mobile number. Then, the unified verification platform returns the ``True'' or ``False'' value and the source information to the mobile phone of the consumer.",

While this trend has been stable this paper illustrate how corresponding support for end-user programming of mobile applications is still missing. To address this need this paper presents the SATIN platform and its underlying design concepts.

The approach is based on the integration of a semantic framework, where a reasoner can take decisions about the configuration of robot services and resources. An ontology has been designed to model the robot and the relevant context information. Besides rules are used to encode human knowledge and serve as policies for the reasoner. The approach has been successfully implemented in a mobile robot, which showed to be more capable of solving not pre-designed situations.",

abstract="The runtime management of Internet of Things (IoT) oriented applications deployed in multi-clouds is a complex issue due to the highly heterogeneous and dynamic execution environment. To effectively cope with such an environment, the cross-layer and multi-cloud effects should be taken into account and a decentralized self-adaptation is a promising solution to maintain and evolve the applications for quality assurance. An important issue to be tackled towards realizing this solution is the uncertainty effect of the adaptation, which may cause negative impact to the other layers or even clouds. In this paper, we tackle such an issue from the planning perspective, since an inappropriate planning strategy can fail the adaptation outcome. Therefore, weÂ present an architectural model for decentralized self-adaptation to support the cross-layer and multi-cloud environment. We also propose a planning model and method to enable the decentralized decision making. The planning is formulated as a Reinforcement Learning problem and solved using the Q-learning algorithm. Through simulation experiments, we conduct a study to assess the effectiveness and sensitivity of the proposed planning approach. The results show that our approach can potentially reduce the negative impact on the cross-layer and multi-cloud environment.",

Two rather distinct, but at the same time collaborating, domains are the ones of computer science and medicine; the former offers significant aid towards a more efficient understanding of the latter's research trends. Still, the process of meaningfully analyzing and understanding medical information and data is a tedious one, bound to several challenges. One of them is the efficient utilization of contextual information in the process leading to optimized, context-aware data analysis results. Nowadays, researchers are provided with tools and opportunities to analytically study medical data, but at the same time significant and rather complex computational challenges are yet to be tackled, among others due to the humanistic nature and increased rate of new content and information production imposed by related hardware and applications.

abstract="As the number of devices connected to the Internet increases, the interactions between the general population and Cyber-Physical Systems multiplies. Most of these interactions occur through people's smart devices. Thanks to the large number of sensor included on these devices and their capabilities to connect to other sensors they serve as a gateway to Cyber-Physical Systems. However, most of the capabilities of these devices are underutilized, since they are only used to upload the sensed information to centralized cloud servers. This paper presents the key challenges that must be faced to build distributed and context-aware human-centric Cyber-Physical Systems that take advantage of the capabilities of modern smart devices. In addition, the concept of Situational-Context is introduced as a possible solution addressing these challenges. Situational-Context is a new computational model that use smart devices to gather the virtual profiles of their owners. These profiles are combined and used to adapt and control the behaviour of Cyber-Physical Systems. This computational model could contribute to a new generation of distribute human-centric systems with a clear social orientation.",

abstract="The widespread introduction of lightweight IT---smartphones, tablets, the Internet of Things, and the growth of third-party app developers---has become a challenge for many organizations. Local units and end-users increasingly are acquiring and implementing lightweight IT outside the realm of the IT function. The trend is driven by competent users' need for innovative IT services, enabled by the consumerization of digital technologies. Lightweight IT entails exciting business opportunities; however, guidance for managers on how to deal with this development has been very limited. In this paper, we investigate which IT governance models organizations can apply to manage lightweight IT. The managerial challenge is to balance the innovative potential of lightweight IT with the requirements of good governance. Building on the particular challenges of lightweight IT and the extant literature on end-user computing, we present a framework with four alternative governance models. We evaluate the framework through four e-health case studies.",

abstract="Ten years ago, researchers in multi-agent systems became more and more aware that agent systems consist of more than only agents. The series of workshops on Environments for Multi-Agent Systems (E4MAS 2004-2006) emerged from this awareness. One of the primary outcomes of this endeavor was a principled understanding that the agent environment should be considered as a primary design abstraction, equally important as the agents. A special issue in JAAMAS 2007 contributed a set of influential papers that define the role of agent environments, describe their engineering, and outline challenges in the field that have been the drivers for numerous follow up research efforts. The goal of this paper is to wrap up what has been achieved in the past 10 years and identify challenges for future research on agent environments. Instead of taking a broad perspective, we focus on three particularly relevant topics of modern software intensive systems: large scale, openness, and humans in the loop. For each topic, we reflect on the challenges outlined 10 years ago, present an example application that highlights the current trends, and from that outline challenges for the future. We conclude with a roadmap on how the different challenges could be tackled.",

In this paper, we have designed cloud-assisted pillow robot (CP-Robot) for emotion sensing and interaction. First, we use the signals collected from the Smart Clothing, CP-Robot and smart phones to judge the users' moods; then we realize the emotional interaction and comfort between users through the CP-Robot; and finally, we give a specific example about a mother who is on a business trip comforting her son at home through the CP-Robot to prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the system.",

When drivers are in bad mood or tired, their vigilance level decreases, which may prolong the reaction time to emergency situation and lead to serious accidents. With the help of mobile sensing and mood-fatigue detection, drivers' mood-fatigue status can be detected while driving, and then appropriate measures can be taken to eliminate the fatigue or negative mood to increase the level of vigilance. This paper presents the basic concepts and current solutions of mood-fatigue detection and some common solutions like mobile sensing and cloud computing techniques. After that, we introduce some emerging platforms which designed to promote safe driving. Finally, we summarize the major challenges in mood-fatigue detection of drivers, and outline the future research directions.",

abstract="Device-to-Device (D2D) communications have received significant attention nowadays due to the excess number of applications and services. D2D communication promises a higher data rate, lower communication delays, and better power efficiency. Therefore, D2D is expected to be a vital technical component in Internet of Things (IoT) and play an important role with the next generation 5G. Moreover, the rapid growth in mobile capabilities opens the door to the cyber criminals that explore new avenues for malware attacks. Although the literature is proposed security schemes for malware attacks. However, the research field is still immature and unexplored in depth due to the fast evolution of malware at a rate far exceeding the evolution of security techniques. In this paper, the problem of detecting malware attacks is considered in D2D network and a secure energy-efficient routing protocol is proposed. The protocol aims at detecting malware attached to message before it infects the targeted device through optimal secure energy-efficient routes. Moreover, the protocol takes into account the attacker's behavior, computation of players' strategies including different attack cases and consideration of the dynamic scheme in terms of calculating malware detection capabilities and malware types due to the fast evolution of the malware. Through simulations, the proposed routing protocol is evaluated in terms of the detecting rate of the malicious messages and overall expected payoff of the defender compared with other non-strategic routing protocols. Results show that the game achieves Nash equilibrium, and leads to an optimal defense strategy for the network.",

Interesting research questions arise due to this convergence. For example, how to efficiently retrieve underlying contexts that are difficult to recognize especially with resource-limited handheld devices, how to make use of these contexts for achieving self-management, and how to process large-scale contexts. These challenges require that researchers from software engineering, artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, high-performance distributed systems, cloud and mobile computing, etc. collaborate in order to make systems work in an efficiently self-managed manner.",

Physiological multi-sensor studies have been conducted previously to detect stress. In this study, we focus on electrocardiography (ECG) monitoring that can now be performed with minimally invasive wearable patches and sensors, to develop an efficient and robust mechanism for accurate stress identification, for example in automobile drivers. A unique aspect of our research is personalized individual stress analysis including three stress levels: low, medium and high. Using machine learning algorithms from the ECG signals alone, our system achieves up to 100{\%} accuracy and area under ROC curve of 1 depending on the experimental setting in detecting three classes of stress using feature selection from a combination of fiducial points and multiscale entropy as a fine-grained indicator of stress level.",

The aim of this paper is to examine whether the Big Data research community reached the same level of maturity. For this purpose, we provide a framework identifying existing and emerging research areas of Big Data. This framework is based on five dimensions, including the SMACIT perspective. Current and past research in Big Data are analyzed using a bibliometric study of publications based on more than a decade of related academic publications.

abstract="Playing is part of children's daily life and it is an important aspect of their development because it promotes not only entertainment, but also influences the psychological, physiological and social development of children. The playful aspect of the toys awakens other interests in Children with Disabilities (CwD), encouraging them to set aside their limitations. However, they are often prevented from playing because the toys are not accessible. Studies also show that the adoption of accessible toys can be an effective resource in CwD rehabilitation treatment. Thus, this work presents the results of a Systematic Review that investigated methods, techniques and interaction strategies used for coeiving and/or adapting accessible toys for CwD. In the context of this research, accessible and interactive toys are named Inclusive Toys (IT). The results of this SR allowed researchers to formulate hypotheses from the interaction and automation resources identified, to specify a model for the conception and design of IT supported by PD techniques.",

abstract="The Internet of Things (IoT) is an environment in which ``things'' (objects, animals or people) are provided with unique identifiers (IPv6 addresses) and the ability to communicate over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. Radio-Frequency Identification Technology (RFID) is the key enabler of the IoT. The RFID Implant System considered in the proposed work consists of an implantable, passive RFID tag which is a data carrying device that is attached to the object to be identified, RFID reader which communicates with the tag in order to read or write data to its memory and, the back-end database which stores information related to the identified object. There are several security issues associated with the use of RFID tags in IoT like eavesdropping, impersonation, cloning, replay attack, tag destruction, unauthorized tag reading, tag modification etc. To defend such attacks effectively, efficient security mechanisms are essential. So, the proposed system aims to provide a secure mutual authentication mechanism based on Hyper Elliptic Curve Cryptography (HECC) to authenticate the communication between the RFID tag and reader. The security of Hyper-elliptic Curve Cryptosystem depends on the hardness of solving hyper-elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (HCDLP). This problem helps to avoid the eavesdropper from breaking into the security of the HECC cryptosystem. The proposed work also uses D-Quark hash algorithm.",

Blockchains are the distributed ledger technology underlying Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies; the payments layer the Internet never had; a mechanism for updating truth states in distributed network computing through consensus trust; and overall, a new form of general computational substrate. Blocktime is the time over which a certain number of blocks will have confirmed; and this creates an alternative event trajectory in time which can be offset against human-time or other computing clocktime regimes for arbitrage or complementary purposes. The result of this effort is to show that blocktime allows the contingency of future events to be more robustly orchestrated through temporality as a selectable smart contract feature.",

This paradigm aims to integrate and use in Internet electronic embedded devices like sensors, in order to share information and allowing interaction from anywhere. Standard communication protocols used in IoT for data transmission are based in general on FSK (Frequency Shift Keying) techniques that do not have the range and necessary performance to deal with this new scenery. With this situation in mind Semtech Technologies have developed a new modulation technique called LoRa (Long Range) based on spread spectrum that offer a new communication model for low power and long range networks, impossible to implement with other techniques. In this paper, we describe a new communication protocol implemented over the physical layer of LoRa providing effectiveness, robustness and low power consumption suitable for IoT applications in the context of smart cities. Results obtained related with the coverage analysis confirm the success of the selection of this technology and opens new horizons for developing useful applications in domains like smart cities, e-health, smart factory, remote monitoring and control, etc.",

abstract="The main body of research clearly highlights the world's population is rapidly expanding. When this fact is combined with the increase in life longevity due to medical and social advances it alters the demographic balance in relation to age. Hence, the number of people aged 65 and over is constantly increasing. The potential of Smart Technologies and IoT-based devices to improve health has increased rapidly in the last few years and users are now in a position to contribute to the development of the interaction process and need to be properly trained on benefits of using new technologies. IFTTT (If This Then That), Blockly, and other similar tools provide a new perspective on web-based services, and represent an innovative and inclusive instrument to manage small automated tasks between Internet-connected devices by using a simplified interaction approach. The main research question of this work is: how could senior users benefit and adopt smart devices in a proficient way and how can emerging technologies such as automation services enhance safety, health and well-being for people with different abilities? The research method is based on a participatory, Inclusive Design approach, developed through interviews and focus groups, among a restricted number of people of different age and gender, design and usability tests in the further stage. The aim of the work is to make existing technologies more accepted, usable and inclusive for as many people as possible. This goal will be achieved by analysis and by creating a set of interactive and easy to use information and tools for automating different processes, to improve the performance in Activities of Daily Living and increase the connection and socialization between citizens, their family and friends. Applets for Seniors could be seen as a different approach to enable users with different abilities in interacting in a friendly way with new technologies and could be also used as a User Experience facilitator for people who are not familiar with smart devices.",

abstract="Embedded devices have permeated into our daily lives and significant day-to-day mundane tasks involve a number of embedded systems. These include smart cards, sensors in vehicles and industrial automation systems. Satisfying the requirements for trusted, reliable and secure embedded devices is more vital than ever before. This urgency is also strengthened further by the potential advent of the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems. As our reliance on these devices is increasing, the significance of potential threats should not be underestimated, especially as a number of embedded devices are built to operate in malicious environments, where they might be in the possession of an attacker. The challenge to build secure and trusted embedded devices is paramount. In this paper, we examine the security threats to embedded devices along with the associated prevention mechanisms. We also present a holistic approach to the security and trust of embedded devices, from the hardware design, reliability and trust of the runtime environment to the integrity and trustworthiness of the executing applications. The proposed protection mechanisms provide a high degree of security at a minimal computational cost. Such an agnostic view on the security and trust of the embedded devices can be pivotal in their adoption and trust acquisition from the general public and service providers.",

abstract="As a result of the remarkable advances in sensing and digital communication technologies, massive amounts of data are generated by Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In this paper, we propose a framework for data provisioning that relies on the Data-as-a-Service (DaaS) cloud delivery model. IoT Data is processed and aggregated at the edge of where it is generated, then, it is stored in the cloud. Since smart connected devices are proliferating at an unprecedented pace, we anticipate that the number of DaaS providers will also grow at the same rate. Therefore, data consumers will seek to find suitable DaaS providers that can provide them with high-quality data. DaaS Brokers will emerge to mediate between data providers and data consumers and help data consumers find appropriate DaaS providers using different ranking algorithms. We propose an algorithm to evaluate the offers of potential DaaS providers based on the quality-of-data (QoD) requirements of the data consumer and using fitness functions associated with each QoD dimension.",

abstract="Patients in intensive care often have a dozen or more medical devices and sensors attached to them. Each is a self-contained system that operates in ignorance of the others, and their integrated operation as a system of systems that delivers coherent therapy is performed by doctors and nurses. But we can easily imagine a scenario where the devices recognize each other and self-integrate (perhaps under the guidance of a master ``therapy app'') into a unified system. Similar scenarios can be (and are) envisaged for vehicles and roads, and for the devices and services in a home. These self-integrating systems have the potential for significant harm as well as benefit, so as they integrate they should adapt and configure themselves appropriately and should construct an ``assurance case'' for the utility and safety of the resulting system. Thus, trustworthy self-integration requires autonomous adaptation, synthesis, and verification at integration time, and this means that embedded automated deduction (i.e., theorem provers) will be the engine of integration.",

A Process Management System (PMS) employed for executing CPPs is required to automatically adapt its running processes to anomalous situations and exogenous events by minimising any human intervention at run-time. In this paper, we tackle this issue by introducing an approach and an adaptive Cognitive PMS that combines process execution monitoring, unanticipated exception detection and automated resolution strategies leveraging on well-established action-based formalisms in Artificial Intelligence, which allow to interpret the ever-changing knowledge of cyber-physical environments and to adapt CPPs by preserving their base structure.",

This is, in particular, an essential issue for achieving human-centered smart city design. In this paper, we present our methodology to gamify smart city services. Our methodology consists of three tools, one model and two infrastructures. The tools contain the value-based design framework, the personality-based analysis framework, and the reality-based analysis framework. The model is named the GamiMedia model, and the infrastructures include the Virtual Form infrastructure and the Digital-Physical Hybrid Role-Playing infrastructure. The methodology to gamify smart city services is extracted from our long experiences with building applications services and middleware infrastructures for ubiquitous computing environments.",

Today's smart applications leverage IoT technologies that enable collaboration between different entities involved in the application. Further, smart applications provide local intelligence attached each device/physical object. The nature of an IoT application usually differs from time-to-time due to varied context and end-device sensing/response. The key issue is that of understanding the data and control flows which govern the processes that act on the sensed data all the way up to end user application. So, conceptually modeling of data, control and process flow for IoT-driven smart applications is more challenging, especially when further modeling the context and exceptions arise during the execution.

We will first look at open government data, whose ability to be reused enables them to act as tools for generating knowledge and offering new government services and products. We will then turn to big data, whose use carries complex legal and social consequences, and which also serve as a key tool for creating knowledge by making it possible to plot and forecast economic and social trends.

abstract="5G is now the next generation of wireless communication systems. The general demonstration of one technology vision for fifth generation mobile networks is presented in this work. The vision of 5G technology provides guidance for the definition of requirements, architecture, and other aspects. By expanding the performances limits of mobile networks, it is necessary for the 5G to include a flexible designing which can optimize network utilization with large range of examples for partnership and business models. The 5G should include flexibility to optimize the network usage by design. Modular network functions with the ability of on demand deployment and scaling capabilities need to be included in the architecture. The purpose of this inclusion would be to handle the accommodation of various demands in a cost-effective and agile manner. Direct communication in D2D services is one of the new 5G networks characteristics. Advanced technologies such as massive MIMO and millimeter-wave radio systems have significant impact on design of cellular architecture. It is crucial for 5G technology to maintain a massive traffic volume owing to increase efficiency of radio link and density of cells. Also, it is necessary for the network to be transformed in a cloud architecture, which coordinates radio resources of multi-radio access, and inter-cell interference during network deployment. Research trends in 5G tell us that using an aggregation of technologies, it is possible to realize numerous goals. Our use case study for the perspective period post-2020 shows extremely broad variety of applications and their attributes performance.",

abstract="In the last decade, governments, municipalities, and industries have invested large amounts of funds on research on smart cities with the main goal of developing services to improve people's quality of life. Many proposals focus on a Cloud-centric network architecture in which all the data collected from amyriad of sensors devices is transferred to the Cloud for processing. However, this approach presents significant limitations when faced with the formidable traffic generated by the Internet of Things and with the need for low-latency services. The deployment of IoT devices in compact groups, connected to the smart city network infrastructure by relatively powerful ``gateways'', opens the possibility to depart from the centralized architectures and move the computation closer to the data sources. To this end, this paper proposes SPF, a new middleware solution that supports IoT application and service development, deployment, and management. SPF runs IoT services on capable devices located at the edge of the network and proposes a programming model that enables to take advantage of decentralized computation resources in a seamless fashion. SPF also leverages an information dissemination solution designed for constrained network environments and adopts Value-of-Information based methods to prioritize transmission of essential information.",

Based on Bachelard's phenomenological approach, we suggest that poetic interaction design begin with imagination and expression-making of both material and computational things. The challenges include how to design successful reverberation and admiration of poetic images while one interacts and reflects. Examining spatial metaphors, we classify poetic interaction into poetic space and interactive artifacts. With gestalt psychology, we present practical guides for designing poetic interaction. Two examples illustrate the relationship between poetic images and expression-making. Finally, we implement a design work, whisper, to explore the framework, as well as validate our findings via a qualitative experiment.

abstract="Energy-efficient computing has increasingly come into focus of research and industry over the last decade. Ultra-low-power architectures are a requirement for distributed sensing, wearable electronics, Internet of Things and consumer electronics. In this paper, we present a dual-mode platform that includes an ultra-low power Cortex Arm M4 microcontroller coupled with a highly energy efficient multi-core parallel processor. The platform is designed to maximize the energy efficiency in sensors applications by exploiting the Cortex Arm M4 to achieve ultra-low power processing and power management, and enables the multi-core processor to provide additional computational power for near-sensor data centric processing (i.e. accelerating Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification) increasing energy efficiency. The proposed platform enhances the application scenarios where on-board processing (i.e. without streaming out the sensor data) enables intensive computation to extract complex features. The platform is geared towards applications with limited energy budget, as for example in mobile or wearable scenarios where the devices are supplied by a battery. Experimental results confirm the energy efficiency of the platform, demonstrate the low power consumption, and the benefits of combining the two processing engines. Compared to a pure microcontroller platform we provide a boost of 80{\texttimes}Â in terms of computational power when running general purpose code and a boost of 560{\texttimes}Â when performing convolutions. Within a reasonable power budged of 20Â mW compatible to battery-operated scenarios the system can perform 345Â MOPS of general purpose code or 1.5Â GOPS of convolutions.",

abstract="Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) technology is attracting more attention with the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT). Wireless sensor networks have been intensively studied for optimizing their life time by enhancing their low power operations. Few studies have been developed in order to deal with mobility. In some cases, nodes move around a specific area and the network topology should adapt fast. Routing protocols should react to topology changes and build new routes. Traditionally, control traffic is used to update routing metrics. Each node will then choose a next-hop among its neighbor nodes based on this routing metric. In this paper, we propose an enhancement based on signal strength monitoring and depth updating in order to improve the routing protocol performance in mobility scenarios where all nodes are moving. This enhancement can be integrated into most data collection routing protocols. It helps them to better cope with mobility and to make faster decisions on updating their next-hop neighbors. We also implemented this enhancement in the Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). We show that through simulations using our technique allows better performance for different routing metrics.",

abstract="We introduce a new methodology for benchmarking the performance per watt of semantic web reasoners and rule engines on smartphones to provide developers with information critical for deploying semantic web tools on power-constrained devices. We validate our methodology by applying it to three well-known reasoners and rule engines answering queries on two ontologies with expressivities in RDFS and OWL DL. While this validation was conducted on smartphones running Google's Android operating system, our methodology is general and may be applied to different hardware platforms, reasoners, ontologies, and entire applications to determine performance relevant to power consumption. We discuss the implications of our findings for balancing tradeoffs of local computation versus communication costs for semantic technologies on mobile platforms, sensor networks, the Internet of Things, and other power-constrained environments.",

abstract="Recent work has begun to focus on the use of games as a platform for energy awareness and eco-feedback research. While technical advancements (wireless sensors, fingerprinting) make timely and tailored feedback an objective within easy reach, we argue that taking into account the users' own personal consumption behavior and tailoring feedback accordingly is a key requirement and a harder challenge. We present a first attempt in this direction, EnergyLife, which is designed to support the users' actions and embeds contextualized feedback triggered by specific actions of the user, called `smart advice'. We conclude by showing the results of a four-month trial with four households that returned promising results on the effectiveness and acceptance of this feature.",

abstract="This paper uses an integrative literature review to explore the concept of re-distributed manufacturing and the opportunities to deliver more regenerative and resilient systems of production and consumption through the application of circular innovation. The study identified multiple similarities between the drivers of re-distributed and circular models of production and consumption that could be fostered by the use of digital intelligence. A set of criteria for redistributed manufacturing and circular innovation were developed and used to identify 33 existing case studies of consumer goods production. Case study analysis resulted in the identification of three types of re-distributed manufacturing that integrated characteristics of circular innovation. The paper concludes by describing some of the future research challenges in the transition towards re-distributed and circular models of production.",

abstract="A four-tier based Smart Home System is proposed in this paper; this type of network architecture is inspired by both the concept of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine to Machine (M2M) technologies. The main purpose of this structure is to establish a centralized resource management system, which can monitor and control each home appliance within a house. This aim and structure can help to overcome the most notable research challenge which is called interoperability of the system. The interoperability can be reflected from how other services such as assisted living and vehicle tracking are able to share and utilize the same resources. One of the structure advantages is to help existing house owners to live in a modern and convenient environment; it is also environmentally friendly by reducing the overall energy consumption within a household. A novel Home System Data Reflect Arc is proposed to minimalize the response time and limit unnecessary data transmission. Finally, with the aid and optimization of wireless sensor networks, a Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) based indoor localization approach is proposed which is novel based on the fact that it does not require specialized implementation, nor does it require people to wear specialized hardware as it is part of a passive device free environment.

abstract="Wireless sensor networks are envisaged in military, commercial and healthcare applications, where data security is an important aspect. Security of the data in the network is based on the cryptographic technique and the way in which encryption and decryption keys are established among the nodes. Managing the keys in the network includes node authentication, key agreement and key update phases which poses an additional overhead on network resources. Both Symmetric and Asymmetric key techniques when applied separately in WSN fails to provide a scheme suitable for wide range of applications. Hybrid key management scheme is scalable alternative to match security requirements of WSN with minimum overhead on available resources. Heterogeneous WSN is considered in which ID based key establishment and polynomial based key pre-distribution scheme are proposed for higher and lower level of hierarchy respectively. The results of the proposed hybrid key management scheme indicate reduced resource overhead and improved security level.",

abstract="Smart care technology which has made strides is recognized vital in the aging society. This study was intended to examine trends and outlook of smart care by type of elderly and situation to spur improvement in health management for the elderly. Smart cares by type of elderly and situation were elderly-friendly smart home, smart care for management of chronic diseases in the elderly, and smart care for the elderly living alone. Smart care is needed to be implemented actively not only to reduce medical costs and improve the quality of medical services but also to ensure safety and quality of life for the elderly. However, multi-faceted efforts need to be made to help overcome the difficulties arising from degraded cognitive function of the elderly, considering the basic orientation of smart care such as mobile, smart, cloud computing, IoT, etc. For that, it would be necessary to develop elderly-friendly devices suited for characteristics of the elderly group and to actively deploy professional manpower, in parallel with active support from related organizations, who can provide instant support to the elderly encountering difficulty with the use, so as to stimulate the smart care service in the period ahead. Furthermore, as health information and privacy information generated in connection with individuals are sensitive data, it would be the most important to ensure that strict security is maintained for safe data transmission and that only necessary part of information is shared selectively.",

These will be captured through one or several wearable sensors and a couple of handheld ``Robodoc'' consumer devices. Welcome to the brave new world of consumer-driven healthcare! Of course, we have seen this movie many times before. As set of technologies---nano, geno, driverless cars, the Internet of Things---comes out of its early developmental closet, technology pilots signal as-of-yet hard to measure future potential, investors glimpse a gold rush of opportunities, the media and industry analysts get involved, and a new hype curve is born (Brown and Michael 2003). Most likely, the technologies in question are first-phase evangelized and vilified in equal measures before being absorbed into our daily life and into existing markets in small, palatable steps that seem curiously less dramatic than the discourse that has surrounded these technologies at the beginning of their public lifecycle. However, as marketing researchers, we do not have much insight into the process through which a technology innovation hype is translated into a fully operational market. Most of the diffusion models that marketing researchers use are derivatives of Rogers' (1962) diffusion of innovation curve. Yet, Rogers' model and subsequent research in marketing has failed to accommodate how markets are actively and often painstakingly constructed, both in a socio-cognitive and material sense, by multiple, diverse, and often competing stakeholders.",

abstract="Around two thirds of the energy consumed by buildings can be traced back to the residential sectors and thus household appliances. Today, most appliances are highly intelligent and networked devices, in principle being able to form complete energy consuming, producing, and managing systems. Reducing the use of energy has therefore become a matter of managing and optimizing the energy utilization at a system level. These systems are technically very heterogeneous, and standardized interfaces on a sensor and device level are therefore needed. Many of the required standards already exist, but a common architecture does not, resulting in a too fragmented and powerless market. To enable semantic interoperability for smart appliances we therefore developed SAREF, the Smart Appliance REFerence ontology. In this paper we present SAREF and describe our experience in creating this ontology in close interaction with the industry, pointing out the lessons learned and identifying topics for follow-up actions.",

abstract="Industrial work, as performed in field engineering and manufacturing, is inherently different from traditional office work. Industrial work is highly mobile and physical, and involves continuous interaction between people and machines in settings such as factory floors, power plants, oil rigs, locomotive maintenance yards, etc. This domain has recently benefitted from a set of disruptive technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT) [2], mobile and wearable computing, and contextual software applications. In particular, GE's Industrial Internet initiative  [1] aims at researching new ways to connect people and machines, enabling communications between people and traditional software systems, between people at work, and between people and intelligent machines. When allied with wearable and mobile computing, the Industrial Internet enables new forms of contextual user experiences focusing on the delivery of the right information to the right user at the right time and place. Moreover, these new technologies have enabled experiences that better adapts to industrial workers' needs. For example, using virtual reality glasses and natural language interaction, workers can readily access information about their tasks at hand, the machines nearby, and people located at a distance. This is achieved with minimal distraction, in a proactive way, leveraging the knowledge about each person's tasks and surroundings. In this paper, we describe a general approach and architecture designed to support contextual and mobile applications in the industrial domain and the application of this architecture in the development of the MyWorld application, a contextual mobile applications that works as a single point of entry for a field engineer's needs.",

It uses Semantic Web standards to describe both the data produced by the sensors, but also the sensors and their networks, which enables interoperability of sensor networks, and provides a way to formally analyze and reason about these networks. Since sensors produce data at a very high rate, they require solutions to reason efficiently about what complex events occur based on the data captured.

abstract="Managing energy production and consumption on a city level is an important, yet challenging task, since an increasing number of volatile renewable energies are being connected to the grid. Smart city energy management platforms could constitute a powerful tool for the involved market actors to effectively integrate renewable energies and thereby to refine existing business models. However, the implementation of such energy management tools is often hindered by privacy concerns or the lack of awareness about connected business benefits. In this paper, we present the concept for a decision support system that is tested in two pilot cities in Croatia and Bulgaria. Furthermore, we present a framework for the identification of the business benefits that are connected with the implementation of such a tool.",

abstract="The rapid development and adoption of Internet and digital technologies dramatically changed business processes, leading to a disruptive digital transformation of the whole industry value chain. The so-called Industry 4.0 refers to a complex evolution of the entire industrial sector that includes technological advances in production equipment (i.e. Additive Manufacturing), smart finished products (IoT), data tools and analytics, involving activities and stakeholders at all levels. Therefore, companies need to completely redesign their business processes and models in order to achieve the important benefits disclosed by these new settings. Even though actual and potential advantages are remarkable, only a limited number of companies has already made rapid advances by developing high digital capabilities necessary to obtain a competitive advantage. The purpose of this paper is to explore this emerging trend through a case study carried out with an Italian company world leader in the food industry, aiming to shed light on opportunities and threats connected to digital transition.",

Although MapReduce processing and its clones have been designed for high-performance server clusters, the processing itself is simple and generalized, so it should be used in non-high-performance computing environments, e.g., IoT and sensor networks. The proposed framework is unique among the other MapReduce-based processing approaches, because it can locally process the data maintained in nodes on the IoT rather than within high-performance server clusters and data centers. It deploys programs for data processing at the nodes that contain the target data as a map step and executes the programs with the local data. Finally, it aggregates the results of the programs to certain nodes as a reduce step. The architecture of the framework, its basic performance, and its application are also described here.",

abstract="As a typical application of Internet of Things (IoT), wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been widely used in many fields, such as remote healthcare, to gather data of monitoring area. However, due to open nature of wireless channel and limited computing and storage resource of sensor node, how to guarantee the sensitive sensed data are only be accessed by valid user becomes an important issue. Many user authentication protocols for WSNs have been proposed to address this issue, however, previous work more or less have their own weaknesses. Recently, Gope and Hwang proposed a lightweight anonymity authentication for WSNs, and they claimed that their protocol is secure against most attacks. However, our analysis indicates that their protocol still has some design and security flaws. To address the security issue for WSNs, a user authentication protocol with privacy protection for WSNs has been proposed. The analysis and comparisons results show that the proposed protocol is a robust and security one for WSNs.",

abstract="The empty nest syndrome has become a significant problem in many countries. Caregivers can help the elderly to cope with some of the issues related to this syndrome, but a tremendous shortage of caregivers is expected due to the low income and high workload. The growing popularity of mobile device use by the elderly has created a great potential for mobile virtual companions. Studies have shown that virtual companions that can show empathy towards its users are perceived as more caring, likeable, trustworthy and supportive. Therefore, we believe that an empathetic companion can help to improve the elderly's emotional wellness and promote an active independent lifestyle. In this work, we propose an empathetic elderly companion based on the psychological theory of empathy in the form of a smart chat bot. The empathetic companion records the elderly's speech during their conversations, extracts phonetic features, and employs a fast online learning algorithm, namely Online Sequential Extreme Learning Machine (OS-ELM), to recognize emotion. Based on the elderly's current emotion, the companion will provide context-aware empathetic responses. The experimental results show that OS-ELM is superior in classifying emotions from phonetic information.",

abstract="The availability of NFC smartphones has facilitated the development of a large number of related applications. Some of these NFC applications necessitate communication with other systems, which may not necessarily be secure, through communication channels and mechanisms that may be open to vulnerabilities. Security is therefore paramount to the success of these NFC mobile services. While Peer-to-Peer (P2P) communication mode is common in mobile NFC applications, it is vulnerable to security-related issues that arise from the use of untrusted devices for storage and to process applications. We propose the concept of a Cloud of Secure Elements (CoSE) where the secure services are hosted by servers rather than by smartphone Secure Elements. We discuss the use of CoSE for mobile payments. We also illustrate how an NFC smartphone may be efficiently used as a bridge between an NFC reader and an Internet server of secure microcontroller that hosts EMV applications.",

A new area of research is cyber immunity. Cyber immune systems try to mimic the adaptive immune system of humans and animals because of its capability to detect and fend off new, unseen pathogens. Today's cyber security systems provide an effective defense mechanism against cyber-attacks. However, traditional firewall and intrusion detection systems often struggle to detect and repel so far unknown attacks. A cyber immune system can mitigate this shortcoming by detecting new, unknown cyber-attacks and by providing a powerful defense mechanism.

Heterogeneous models of human actors, things and robots making a unique dynamic system were developed. The system operates as a distributed, wireless, robot-sensor network configured in the megastore's information structured environment. The smart store is modelled and simulated by several networked PC computers connected to the cloud architecture. The aim of cloud system configuration is to control collaborative strategies of multi-robotic system in the considered application -- high automated megastore. Research results are verified by simulation experiments instead of configuring expensive real experimental system.

abstract="Digital information within an enterprise consists of (1) structured data and (2) unstructured content. The structured data includes enterprise and business data like sales, customers, products, accounts, inventory and enterprise assets, etc. while the content includes contracts, reports, emails, customer opinions, transcribed calls, on-line inquires, complements and complaints. Further, cutting edge businesses also using GPS tracking or surveillance monitors as well as sensor technologies for productivity, performance and efficiency measures, and these are provided by outsourcers etc. Similarly in the Biomedical area, resources can be structured data say in Swiss- Prot or unstructured text information in journal articles stored in content repositories such as PubMed. The structured data and the unstructured content generally reside in entirely separate repositories with the former being managed by a DBMS and the latter by a content manager frequently provided by an outsourcer or vendor [76]. This separation is undesirable since the information content of these sources is complementary. Further, each outsourcer or vendor keep the data on their own Cloud, and data are not sharable between the vendor systems, and most vendor system were not integrated with the enterprise systems, and leaves the organization to consolidate the data and information manually for data analytics. Effective knowledge and information use requires seamless access and intelligent analysis of information in its totality to allow enterprises to gain enhanced critical insights. This is becoming even more important, as the proportion of structured to unstructured information has shifted from 50-50 in the 1960s to 5-95 today [1]. Unless we can effectively utilize the unstructured content conjointly with the structured data, we will only obtain very limited and shallow knowledge discovery from an increasingly narrow slice of information. The techniques developed in our research will then be used to address significant issues in three application areas, but potential applications with significant impact are much more extensive.",

abstract="The integration of modern information and communication technologies (ICTs) into critical infrastructures (CIs) improves its connectivity and functionalities yet also brings cyber threats. It is thus essential to understand the risk of ICTs on CIs holistically as a cyber-physical system and design efficient security hardening mechanisms. To this end, we capture the system behaviors of the CIs under malicious attacks and the protection strategies by a zero-sum game. We further propose a computationally tractable approximation for large-scale networks which builds on the factored graph that exploits the dependency structure of the nodes of CIs and the approximate dynamic programming tools for stochastic Markov games. This work focuses on a localized information structure and the single-controller game solvable by linear programming. Numerical results illustrate the proper tradeoff of the approximation accuracy and computation complexity in the new design paradigm and show the proactive security at the time of unanticipated attacks.",

abstract="First World developed regions are usually those which pioneer technological and social advancements that later spread over the rest of the globe. Mobility has a considerable impact on cities and the regions which contain them. ``Smart cities'' are expected to promote denser city centres where not only private car needs are taken into account. Decision-making is crucial for boosting social cohesion and inclusiveness through the right social appropriation of technological progress. The Spanish region of Navarra and its capital city Pamplona are currently experiencing profound transformations which aim at integrating ``smart city''-related innovations. In spite of the central relevance of the automobile industry for its economy, Pamplona is making efforts for consolidating alternatives to its private car-centred mobility. Intermodal transportation options offer a more sustainable and socially inclusive mobility-paradigm. This paper incorporates an analysis of the narratives and discourses of some of the key stakeholders in play, such as politicians, transportation experts and engineers. Their main viewpoints are examined from a sociological approach as they could predict new collective trends valid not only for this mid-size city but also for many analogous cases.",

However, the existing gap between methods, modelling approaches and viewpoints of the disciplines involved in CPS development creates significant difficulties for creating viable CPS solutions. In this paper we investigate the potential of using enterprise modelling as an integrative method for large parts of CPS development projects. The work is based on a case study from transportation industry. The main contributions of this paper are (1) a case study from transportation illustrating CPS development with business and technical aspects, (2) a discussion of enterprise modelling potential in different development phases of CPS, and (3) a proposal for a CPS development process integrating technical and business aspects.",

These features of the framework provide Rich Internet Applications (RIAs) with ubiquitous access to sophisticated human computer interaction schemes for diverse uses. The proliferation of Smart TVs as central information hubs in elderly assisted living environments, along with the need for simple gesture control schemes for these demographics, provides one application of this framework.

Testbed experiments showed disastrously bad datagram success rates for a collection traffic scenario with large, 6LoWPAN-fragmented datagrams, which significantly differed from the simulation results for a comparable scenario. In this paper we present an experimental setup that enables capturing the MAC and transceiver states of participating nodes in realtime. The results of our experiments show, that for the given fragmentation/collection scenario, the usage of the extended operating mode of the transceiver hardware, which provides CSMA/CA, ACKs and retransmissions in hardware, is responsible for nearly all datagram losses. Therefore, we strongly advise against using such hardware-assisted modes of operation in similar traffic scenarios.",

abstract="Context-awareness is one of the most relevant research areas in Pervasive Computing scope. However, in more complex environments, loosely coupled data and dynamic behavior of the environment can become a source of serious problems. These problems can spread throughout whole proactive behavior and in this way make them difficult to handle. In this paper we argue that there is a lack of research done about the data quality and quality of awareness particularly in this kind of composite systems. We investigate on how to build the semantic layer of the DOHA middleware due to reach the goal of context-awareness. To achieve that we are using a data quality approach and data profiles. In addition, we use ontologies as information representation method and to carry over the information about the profiles to the pervasive environment. By doing so, we assure proper representation of the real world and we are improving semantic data and context-awareness in such environments.",

Traditional questionnaires, customer surveys and sensing groups do not work for analyzing customer experience. However, with the arrival of social media, new sources of customer experience are available that require new methods for analyzing customer's voice. Six Sigma transfer functions provide the methods needed.

abstract="With the popularity of Internet of Things (IOT) applications, various kinds of active sensors are deployed and multivariate time series datasets are generated rapidly. Early classification of multivariate time series is an emerging topic in data mining due to the wide applications in many domains. The unique part of early classification lies in that it uses only earlier part of time series data to reach classification results with the same accuracy as by methods using complete time series information. Although a number of relevant studies have been presented recently, most of them didn't consider the issues of data scale and execution efficiency simultaneously. The main research issue of this paper falls in how to mine interpretable patterns from multivariate time series data, with which effective classification models can be constructed to ensure the accuracy as well as earliness. To take into account the issues of data scale and execution efficiency simultaneously, we explore distributed in-memory computing techniques and multivariate shapelets-based approaches to construct a Spark-based in-memory mining framework to parallelize the feature extraction process. We implement a framework with Multivariate Shapelets Detection (MSD) method as a based example. Through empirical evaluation on various kinds of sensory datasets, the scalability of the framework is evaluated in terms of efficiency while ensuring the same accuracy and reliability in early classification of multivariate time series. This work is the first one to realize multivariate time series early classification on Spark distributed in-memory computing platform, which can serve as a good base for an extension to other time series classification methods based on shapelet feature extraction.",

These representations should also have the ability to adapt over time to the changing state of the world. That is why we propose IoT-O, a core-domain modular IoT ontology proposing a vocabulary to describe connected devices and their relation with their environment.

abstract="With the rapid development of wireless sensor network, cloud computing and Internet of Things, the problems of security and privacy are becoming more and more serious. Elliptic curve cryptography as a public key cryptography plays an important role to solve the security issues, in which scalar multiplication is the most important and time-consuming operation. Koblitz curve is a special class of elliptic curve over binary field, Frobenius endomorphism can be used to accelerate the scalar multiplication. By converting single scalar multiplication into simultaneous multiple scalar multiplication, GLV method can use Straus-Shamir trick to calculate the scalar multiplication. In this paper, we combine the idea of Frobenius endomorphism and GLV method to speed up the scalar multiplication on Koblitz curve. Our algorithm can efficiently convert scalar multiplication into multi-scalar multiplication to reduce the cost of point additions and Frobenius operations. Theoretical analysis results show that: Compared with                                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}tau {\$}{\$}                                                                  $\tau$                                                            -and-add algorithm, our 2-dimensional implementation provides a speedup over 19{\%}, 3-dimensional implementation speeds up over 29{\%}. Finally, a parallel scalar multiplication algorithm for Koblitz curve is designed, which can flexibly select the dimension of the parallel algorithm based on the number r of processing unit.

One of the key features that the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has introduced is the Relay Node (RN), a low power low cost device used to increase the spectral efficiency, especially at the cell edge. In this paper, we propose to use RNs to address a challenging new problem emerging on the horizon: the expected tsunami of Machine-to-Machine (M2M) traffic in cellular and mobile networks (in LTE, and LTE-A). By taking advantage of RN's low cost, low power, and small size we outline the challenges of and one possible design for using RNs to integrate M2M traffic in LTE-A. To the best of our knowledge, this is a novel idea that has not yet been proposed and may give RNs more longevity and therefore greater value.",

abstract="Mobile Application Software (M-Apps) is increasingly popular and by now represents the interactive trendiest software. Investigations about their valuation paradigms are so increasingly common. Even if M-Apps belong to the broad category of Intellectual Property assets, underlying business model is so innovative and different from traditional intangibles that they require new valuation paradigms. The main research question of this paper is to investigate about Service as a primary value driver of M-Apps. A Service-Value-Approach is proposed as a new appraisal method, which embodies customers' perception of M-Apps service value. The empirical evidence fully confirms the hypothesis of the mediating role of Service Quality on application value. This study has practical implications for both scholars and professionals as it provides significant empirical evidence of the role of Service Quality into M-Apps valuation, and value co-creation between providers and users.",

abstract="The ``AVR Butterfly'' (BF) is not just a microcontroller, but rather an autonomous embedded system kit including several sensors. Our main objective was first to provide Internet connectivity to the BF and then to evaluate its further capabilities as a sensor network node. To this end, we equipped the BF with a TCP/IP stack and a Zigbee transceiver. As a case study, we constructed a node and a gateway based on the BF and formed a simple wireless sensor network (WSN). In order to enable remote users to access, on demand, sensor node readings through their web browsers, an HTML Server application was developed for the BF-gateway. We demonstrate that despite the scarcity of the available resources, if we enhance the BF with a popular Ethernet chip and the optimal TCP/IP stack for 8-bit microcontrollers, we can obtain a powerful, yet simple and inexpensive, monitoring device with Internet connectivity capabilities.",

abstract="A wide range of web services are available, with a deployment of a huge number of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, e.g., smart homes, smart cities, intelligent transport, e-health and many more. In the IoT paradigm, almost every device around us will be on the Internet to provide specific services to end users. A large number of services will be available to help end users, however, providing and selecting appropriate service from a massive number of available services is a challenge of IoT. Service discovery plays a vital role in web service architecture. Traditionally, keyword search has been used for service discovery. The traditional approaches of service discovery cannot be applied as it is for web services in the IoT environment as devices providing, and accessing services are resource constrained in nature, e.g., limited size, limited energy source, limited computational capability, and limited memory. Hence, there is need of a lightweight and semantic service discovery approach for the IoT. This work analyzes different service discovery approaches. This analysis will focus on the key requirements of service discovery mechanism needed for the IoT environment.",

Four (4) classification algorithms are being applied on a dataset containing the specifications of known devices (in terms of known device type), which is being used for predicting the unknown devices' types. These algorithms are analyzed using the WEKA data mining tool and a comparative study is undertaken to find the classifier that performs the best analysis on the dataset obtained, using a set of predefined performance metrics to compare the results of each classifier.",

abstract="The vision of ubiquitous computing is increasingly picking up pace. An increasing number of everyday objects are equipped with smart technology and start to form the Internet of Things. Yet, interacting with these devices is based on conventional surfaces made of glass, metal, or plastic. We believe that textile interaction surfaces will be the next frontier of ubiquitous computing and identified many blank spots in the research landscape. Peoples' perception and acceptance of smooth and soft interaction surfaces is insufficiently understood. In this paper we present a study in which 90 people of a wide age range evaluated the suitability of smart textiles in different usage scenarios in the home environment. Overall, a solid willingness to use smart textiles as input devices was found, even though there were conditional acceptance criteria which should be given before participants would be willing to buy them. In contrast to many other technology contexts, however, age is not decisive in the evaluation of the usefulness of smart textiles. Younger and older adults seem to have a quite similar evaluation, hinting at a quite generic acceptance pattern.",

abstract="Business Process Management has substantially matured over the last two decades. The techniques, methods and systems available to scope, model, analyze, implement, execute, monitor and even mine a process have been scientifically researched and can be in most cases deployed in practice. In fact, many of these BPM capabilities are nowadays a commodity. However, an opportunity-rich environment and rapidly emerging digital disruptions require new BPM capabilities. In light of this context, this paper proposes three future research and development directions for BPM academics and professionals. First, Ambidextrous BPM demands the shift of focus from exploitative to explorative BPM. Second, Value-driven BPM postulates a stronger focus on the desired outcomes as opposed to the available BPM methods. Third, Customer Process Management suggests complementing the dominating internal view of BPM with a stronger, design-inspired view on the process experiences of external stakeholders.",

abstract="Certificateless signature cryptography is an efficient approach studied widely because it eliminates the need of certificate authority in public key infrastructure. There are number of security algorithms based on PKC (Public Key Cryptography), ID based certificate less schemes using bilinear maps assumptions. But implementation costs of these schemes are very high. On the other hand RSA is a scheme widely applied in real-life scenarios. So in this paper we proposed a RSA based certificate less signature scheme especially for wireless sensor networks. We have shown that this scheme is secure in random oracles model. A random oracles model is a way to proof the security of cryptographic algorithms which use hash functions and exponential operations in algorithms. Security of this scheme is closely related to discrete logarithm problem. Our scheme provide security against type I attack, type II attack, it also ensures integrity, non-repudiation and authentication.",

The results show that the open source code can be obtained in a variety of formats, and can be freely and easily modified to solve the design problems encountered by individuals or teams, to support the design goals. Through open source resources everyone can get electronic components and a variety of materials, as well as infrastructure and standardization of the production process. So that a number of design elements and open source code can be iterated quickly, having everyone maximize using open source resources efficiency. The design of interactive prototype is based on Arduino/Max6/MSP experiment method and emotional experience method. After the initial design and prototyping, the design concept can be realized. A design route combining usability and ease of use could be established which can be used in the field of industrial design engineering.",

abstract="With the advent of the internet of things and industry 4.0 an enormous amount of data is produced at the edge of the network. Due to a lack of computing power, this data is currently send to the cloud where centralized machine learning models are trained to derive higher level knowledge. With the recent development of specialized machine learning hardware for mobile devices, a new era of distributed learning is about to begin that raises a new research question: How can we search in distributed machine learning models? Machine learning at the edge of the network has many benefits, such as low-latency inference and increased privacy. Such distributed machine learning models can also learn personalized for a human user, a specific context, or application scenario. As training data stays on the devices, control over possibly sensitive data is preserved as it is not shared with a third party. This new form of distributed learning leads to the partitioning of knowledge between many devices which makes access difficult. In this paper we tackle the problem of finding specific knowledge by forwarding a search request (query) to a device that can answer it best. To that end, we use a entropy based quality metric that takes the context of a query and the learning quality of a device into account. We show that our forwarding strategy can achieve over 95{\%} accuracy in a urban mobility scenario where we use data from 30Â 000 people commuting in the city of Trento, Italy.",

abstract="Smart Cities are a trend topic in urban planning as well as in the ICT sector. The cities integrate physical, digital and human systems to deliver a sustainable, prosperous and inclusive future for its citizens. Many of these innovative solutions will be based on technological complexity, as well as the complexity of the various sectoral services involved within a Smart City, and require a system approach to standardization. Such an approach must promote the greatest possible reuse of existing open standards to accelerate the Smart City deployment. In an effort to tackle this issue, the Horizon 2020-project ESPRESSO (systEmic standardisation apPRoach to Empower Smart citieS and cOmmunities) will focus on the development of a conceptual Smart City Information Framework based on open standards within Europe. A further goal of ESPRESSO will be to envisage the impact of those technologies for urban planning and in societal terms. The partner cities will be engaged to analyze how their services can be improved and improved through large-scale use of standards. This will be done by analyzing, the downstream changes that the new scenarios enabled by large-scale interoperability and how they can be integrated in a future Smart City. Based on a detailed requirements-engineering campaign executed in close cooperation with cities, standardization organizations, administrative bodies, and private industry, the project will identify open standards matching the elicited requirements and will establish a baseline for interoperability between the various sectoral data sources and the Smart City enterprise application platform. In a comprehensive set of coordination, support and networking activities, the project will engage a very large number of stakeholders, such as Smart Cities (both existing and those with aspirations), European Standardization Organizations (ESOs), National Standardization Bodies (NSBs), Standards Development Organizations (SDOs), public administrations, industries, SMEs, and other institutions.",

abstract="Adaptability to changing environments and environmental conditions is a key concern for future smart applications. Therefore, for autonomous systems it will be necessary to extend the local view on the environment with external sensors, either fixed or mobile ones. New evolving technologies support the acquisition of a myriad of information, described as ``Internet of Things'', ``Intelligent Environments'', ``Industrial or Building Automation'', ``Ambient Intelligence'', or ``Ubiquitous/Pervasive Computing'', etc. Thus, information is always available, but its interpretation and integration into the own view remains an open problem. We therefore propose the development of a new type of distributed middleware for the environmental perception, that abstracts the environment from the diversity of available sensor systems. In three steps we describe how more and more functionalities can be extracted from the control application to support artificial perception and environment modelling.",

This paper presents the development of a context-aware mobile support system for personalised assistance in industrial environments. Combining the individual strengths of learning and content management systems with the ubiquity of delivering relevant content to users carrying NFC (Near Field Communication) enabled mobile devices, the system aims at both enhancing personnel competences as well as their work efficiency.

abstract="Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are an indispensable part of the emerging Internet of Things. The topology of a WSN is a graph representing the sensor nodes and their interconnecting links. To reduce the energy consumption of a WSN, a topology control algorithm inactivates inessential links, and the sensor nodes reduce their transmission power while preserving crucial integrity properties (e.g., connectivity). In previous work, we have shown that model-driven engineering allows to prototype topology control algorithms that (i) preserve the specified integrity properties and (ii) can be rapidly evaluated in a network simulator. In this paper, we complement our approach by proposing cMoflon, an open-source tool that generates embedded C code for hardware sensor testbeds. The target platform is the Contiki WSN operating system. To show the applicability of cMoflon, we generate code for three representative topology control algorithms: kTC, l*-kTC, and LMST. A comparison of the generated topology control algorithms with their manually tuned counterparts for TelosB sensor nodes shows that cMoflon generates embedded code that is competitive w.r.t. code memory usage.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) devices are prevalent in all aspects of our lives, e.g., thermostat and smart lights. Nowadays, IoT devices are controlled by various end-user applications. There is a lack of a standard interface that allows the communication among various IoT devices. In this context, the functionalities of IoT devices may be published as IoT services. IoT services are RESTful services that connect to IoT devices. The uniform interface of IoT services allows them to be integrated with existing applications. We propose an approach that automatically transforms functionalities of IoT devices to IoT services hosted on the cloud. Our approach identifies the code methods from IoT applications that have to be transformed and also extracts service specifications (e.g., input/output parameters) from these methods. Our case study result shows that our approach obtains a precision and a recall above 70{\%}. The identified methods and service specifications are converted to IoT services. Our approach generates IoT services with an accuracy of 96{\%}.",

The limited power supply of the batteries is the key concern in Wireless Sensor Network even with the alternate energy sources. The energy dissipation model of all the sensors are not the same as some of the routes have more traffic and some of the nodes play the vital role of cluster head. It is necessary to manage the energy of nodes and all the operations are to be energy-aware, to extend the lifetime of the Network. This paper discusses about a lifetime model with the energy dissipation method to predict the life of nodes and tune the algorithms accordingly, so that the entire Logistic system can be autonomous and self managed. The knowledge representation and application of knowledge both are equally important, the trend on energy-dissipation-knowledge and the trend on network-communication operation-knowledge, based on the mathematical model of the network, energy dissipation and prediction of the lifetime of the sensors in logistics domain are considered in this paper.",

abstract="Airport noise prediction is of vital importance to the planning and designing of airports and flights, as well as in controlling airport noise. Benefited from the development of the Internet of things, large-scale noise monitoring systems have been developed and applied to monitor the airport noise, thus a large amount of real-time noise data has been collected, making it possible to train an airport noise prediction model using an appropriate machine learning algorithm. Support vector machine (SVM) is a powerful machine learning algorithm and has been demonstrated to have better performance than many existing algorithms. Thus, we intend to adopt SVM as the base learning algorithm. However, in some cases, the monitored airport noise data contains many outliers, which degrades the prediction performance of the trained SVM. To enhance its outlier immunity, in this paper, we design a Local Outlier Factor based Fuzzy Support Vector Regression algorithm (LOF-FSVR) for airport noise prediction, in which we calculate the fuzzy membership of each sample based on a local outlier factor. In addition, ensemble learning has become a powerful paradigm to effectively improve the prediction performance of individual models, motivated by ensemble learning, we propose a LOF-FSVR based ensemble prediction model to improve the prediction accuracy and reliability of single LOF-FSVR airport noise prediction model. Conducted experiments on the monitored airport noise data demonstrate the good performance of the proposed airport noise prediction model.",

The first one is realized by means of semantic technologies and allows to generate more abstract information from raw sensor data by also considering knowledge about the environment. The second one is realized by means of Fuzzy Formal Concept Analysis and allows to organize and classify abstract information, coming from the first phase, by generating a knowledge representation structure, namely lattice, that can be traversed to obtain information about occurring situation and augment human perception.

abstract="A wireless sensor network is one popular candidate for the fundamental backbone of IoT (Internet of Things). Among the key technologies involved in wireless sensor networks, fault detection techniques are indispensable for maintaining the availability of sensor applications. To employ a distributed fault detection scheme, we address a generalized data inconsistency detection model and apply it to recognize data inconsistencies within a wireless sensor network. Then, we formally prove that data inconsistencies can be correctly recognized under the requisite conditions, and we evaluate the robustness of the generalized data inconsistency detection under the probability fault model. Our numerical result indicates that the degree of robustness eventually approaches to 1 if the node reliability is greater than 0.5. Moreover, we show that the tolerable defect rate of the generalized data inconsistency detection is strictly less than                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}frac{\{}1{\}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                            1                      2                                                                    , so its defect-free rate must be greater than                                                                   {\$}{\$}{\backslash}frac{\{}1{\}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}{\$}                                                                            1                      2                                                                    .

abstract="Industry 4.0 is an important trend aiming at increasing competitiveness and rebalancing value creation in global networks. It targets the reduction of production costs while improving product quality and production scalability and individualization by means of digitalization of product and production. Products as well as their production are becoming cognitive and can therefore better adapt to given customer needs or production variations. In this paper, we discuss impacts of Industry 4.0 along the entire automotive supply chain. In particular, we illustrate that Industry 4.0 in the automotive context has a high cross-impact between development, production, operation and maintenance, thus requiring innovative solutions along the entire value creation chain.",

abstract="Typically, web search users submit short and ambiguous queries to search engines. As a result, users spent much time in formulating query in order to retrieve relevant information in the top ranked results. In this paper, term association graph is employed in order to provide query suggestion by assessing the linkage structure of the text graph constructed over a collection of documents. In addition to that, a biologically inspired model based on Ant Colony Optimisation (ACO) has been explored and applied over term association graph as learning process that addresses the problem of deriving optimal query suggestions. The user interactions with the search engine is treated as an individual ant's navigation and the collective navigations of all ants over the time result in strengthening more significant paths in a term association graph which in turn used to provide query modification suggestions. We present an algorithm that attempts to select the best related keyword among all possible suggestions for an input search query and discuss its implementation based on a ternary search tree and graph data structure. We experimentally study the performance of the proposed method in comparing with different techniques.",

abstract="Internet of Things (IoT) is an emerging paradigm which enables physical objects to operate over the Internet, and collect and share the data that describe the real physical world. In this ubiquitous environment, due to the heterogeneity of objects, communication, topology, security protocols, and the computationally limited nature of IoT objects, conventional authentication schemes may not meet the IoT security requirements since they are considered impractical, weak, or outdated. In this paper, a two-factor inter device mutual authentication scheme for smart home is proposed, where in the first level, the key exchange is performed using the Diffie-Hellman protocol and a public key cryptography in order to validate the identity of devices; and the second level relies on the use of infrared communication to distribute the One-Time Passwords (OTPs) among devices for authentication purpose. The HLPSL language is used to model the proposed protocol, and a security analysis is conducted using the SPAN (Security Protocol Animator for AVISPA (SPAN)/AVISPA (Automated Validation of Internet Security Protocol and Applications) tool, showing that the proposed scheme can achieve the goals of secrecy of secret keys and mutual authentication. A proof-of-concept in the form of a hardware design is also proposed using Raspberry-Pi, Linux Infrared Remote Control (LIRC), Infrared circuit and a public-key-infrastructure. Experimentally, it is shown that this hardware design can achieve secure device-to-device authentication.",

abstract="Smart City projects are moving from trials to complete Smart City realizations. Smart Cities must work as complex ecosystems of interoperable and composable services yet there is currently a proliferation of less than interoperable and portable vertical services. To diminish the barriers among these silos different approaches have been attempted but no single one of them has garnered general acceptance and adoption. The international initiative Internet of Things Enabled Smart City Framework (IES-City) convenes a broad set of stakeholders to build a consensus foundation of architectural principles for interoperable Smart Cities. IES-City evaluates global existing frameworks, tools and applications to distil a common set of Pivotal Points of Interoperability (PPI). PPI have the potential to enable both interoperability and suitable variation and reduce barriers to composable Smart City deployments. The IES-City concept is that such PPI exist in practice and need only be discovered. This paper describes the IES-City methodology.",

abstract="Complex Event processing (CEP) usually focuses on analyzing raw atomic events in order to detect composite events. Usually, a composite event is defined as the pattern actively searched by a CEP system. However, considering uncertainty in some paradigms, such as internet of things, is still an open issue. In current approaches the confidence value related to the occurrence of an event is usually not communicated to the CEP system. As a consequence, a complex event pattern doesn't take this information into account. Nevertheless, even if static, they are useful for pattern definition and particularly for a more accurate constraint definition. We propose to manage this information through domain ontologies. In this paper we describe the architecture for the enrichment of CEP queries to enable evolutivity and flexibility in CEP systems according to event sources [9].",

abstract="Along with the increasing importance of software systems for our daily life, attacks on these systems may have a critical impact. Since the number of attacks and their effects increases the more systems are connected, the secure operation of IT systems becomes a fundamental property. In the future, this importance will increase, due to the rise of systems that are directly connected to our environment, e.g., cyber-physical systems and the Internet of Things. Therefore, it is inevitable to find and fix security-relevant weaknesses as fast as possible. However, established automated security testing techniques such as fuzzing require significant computational effort. In this paper, we propose an approach to combine security testing with usage-based testing in order to increase the efficiency of security testing. The main idea behind our approach is to utilize that little tested parts of a system have a higher probability of containing security-relevant weaknesses than well tested parts. Since the execution of a system by users can also be to some degree being seen as testing, our approach plans to focus the fuzzing efforts such that little used functionality and/or input data are generated. This way, fuzzing is targeted on weakness-prone areas which in turn should improve the efficiency of the security testing.",

abstract="Wireless Sensor and Actuator Networks (WSNs) are distributed sensor and actuator networks that monitor and control real-world phenomena, enabling the integration of the physical with the virtual world. They are used in domains like building automation, control systems, remote healthcare, etc., which are all highly process-driven. Today, tools and insights of Business Process Modeling (BPM) are not used to model WSN logic, as BPM focuses mostly on the coordination of people and IT systems and neglects the integration of embedded IT. WSN development still requires significant special-purpose, low-level, and manual coding of process logic. By exploiting similarities between WSN applications and business processes, this work aims to create a holistic system enabling the modeling and execution of executable processes that integrate, coordinate, and control WSNs. Concretely, we present a WSN-specific extension for Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) and a compiler that transforms the extended BPMN models into WSN-specific code to distribute process execution over both a WSN and a standard business process engine. The developed tool-chain allows modeling of an independent control loop for the WSN.",

abstract="In this paper, we introduce and discuss Foreground Trust. Foreground Trust, itself based on recent work in the area of Trust Enablement, is a paradigm for allowing devices in a human-device ecosystem the means to reason with and about trust in themselves, other devices, and humans, whilst allowing humans to make trusting decisions using their own internal models (whatever they may be) based on cues from the environment --- including the device(s) in use at the time. We discuss the paradigm, and present an actualization of it in the form of Device Comfort, a model of device reasoning based on environmental cues, and the use of the device status to help users make informed trusting and security decisions for themselves. In particular we focus on the interface between user and device to help the user make trust-based decisions and use second thoughts as a means to educate and raise user awareness about their security in online and mobile behaviours.",

abstract="Within the framework of this study, the problem of insufficient effectiveness of interaction between information spaces of various departments was discussed, in particular, duplication of hardware, software, data and methods of their processing, which is especially important in the conditions of instability of the economic situation in the country and in a world, and excludes extensive approaches to the region's information infrastructure development by increasing budgetary funding only. In order to deal with this problem, the notion of NBIC (nano, bio, info, cogni) information space was introduced, the content of NBIC clusters was disclosed. Periodization of the evolution of the regional informatization management system had been carried out, key factors of transition to NBIC convergence were shown. The concept of convergence of information spaces was introduced and its role in the characterized process of NBIC convergence was shown. The synergetic effect of the information space transformation to the NBIC information space has been determined. The necessity of transformation of development vector of the information space for the transition to NBIC information space was shown. The economic efficiency of the transition to NBIC information space has been determined. Methods and models for assessing the social effect from the transition to NBIC information space were characterized. Rationale for improving the management of the information space through the transition to NBIC information space was justified. It was proved that the transition to NBIC information space will allow to ensure the convergence of clusters of information spaces. Finally, conclusions are made about the applicability of developed methods and models in the process of managing the informatization of the region and also further prospects for research are shown.",

abstract="A smart toy is defined as a device consisting of a physical toy component that connects to one or more toy computing services to facilitate gameplay in the Cloud through networking and sensory technologies to enhance the functionality of a traditional toy. A smart toy in this context can be effectively considered an Internet of Things (IoT) with Artificial Intelligence (AI) which can provide Augmented Reality (AR) experiences to users. Referring to the direction of the United States Federal Trade Commission Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the European Union Data Protection Directive (EUDPD), this study adopts the definition of a child to be an individual under the age of 13 years old. In this study, the first assumption is that children do not understand the concept of privacy. The second assumption is that children will disclose as much information to smart toys as they can trust. Breaches of privacy can result in physical safety of child user, e.g., child predators. While the parents/legal guardians of a child strive to ensure their child's physical and online safety and privacy, there is no common approach for these parents/guardians to study the information flow between their child and the smart toys they interact with. This paper discusses related privacy requirements for smart toys in a toy computing environment with a case study on a commercial smart toy called Hello Barbie from Mattel.",

With the advent of Cyber Physical Systems, where big data is collected from heterogeneous sensors and other data sources, finding a suitable normalization technique is also a challenge to enable data fusion (integration). Therefore, data fusion and aggregation of criteria are similar processes of combining values either from criteria or from sensors to obtain a common score. In this study, our aim is to discuss metrics for assessing which are the most appropriate normalization techniques in decision problems, specifically for the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) multi-criteria method. AHP uses a pairwise approach to evaluate the alternatives regarding a set of criteria and then fuses (aggregation) the evaluations to determine the final ratings (scores).",

abstract="This article discusses an effective revocation scheme for disconnected Delay Tolerant Vehicular Ad hoc Networks (VANETs). Malicious vehicles can exhibit various misbehaviour such as dropping packets due to selfish reasons. Selfishness can be due to the need to conserve limited resources such as energy and bandwidth. This forces vehicles to either drop all or some of the packets they receive. This is particularly obtainable in multi-hop forwarding networks where packets are routed from one vehicle to another towards their destination. When some packets are dropped, the usefulness of the system is not fully realised since it affects the quality of information available to vehicles for making driving decisions such as road manoeuvres. Additionally, packet dropping can degrade the routing efficiency of the system. In extreme cases of misbehaviour, it is important to stop such vehicles from further participation in network communication. One way of achieving this is through revocation. However, it is important to establish mechanisms for identifying such vehicles before blacklisting them for revocation. Our objective here is to address the question of how much we can use a trust-based scheme where vehicles cannot always be expected to follow normal protocols for revocation. Revocation or suspension of misbehaving vehicles is essential to avoid havoc and possible economic damage.",

abstract="Generic standards on risk management and functional safety (e.g. ISO 31000 and IEC 61508) and similar frameworks proved to be surprisingly efficient to trigger and consolidate a widely accepted and ever more effective best practice frontier for risk control. In particular, this includes fundamental and applied research activities to improve processes and to provide more advanced, interlinked and effective methods for risk control. However, this also included the identification of yet unresolved challenges and lacks of completeness. The present work goes beyond these frameworks to address the need for a joint approach to frame resilience management and quantification for system development and improvement. It is understood as extending classical risk control to creeping or sudden disruptive, unexpected (unexampled) events, as strongly focusing on technical systems and organizational capabilities to bounce back (better) and as providing generic (technical) resilience capabilities for such resilience response performance. To this end, the article presents general resilience requirements, a resilience management process, which systematically refers to a resilience method taxonomy, resilience levels as well as an applicability table of methods to different resilience management steps for each resilience level. Three case studies elucidate the approach: (i) disruption effect simulation for the Swiss energy grid, (ii) data-driven resilience of the urban transport system of Florence, and (iii) Ontario provincial resilience model in Canada. The approach comprises representative existing resilience concepts, definitions, quantifications as well as resilience generation and development processes. It supports the development of further refined resilience management and quantification processes and related improved methods in particular to cover jointly safety and security needs as well as their practical application to a wide range of socio-technical cyber-physical hybrid systems. This will foster credible certification of the resilience of critical infrastructure, of safety and security critical systems and devices.",

abstract="The growing concern about IAQ has accelerated the development of small, low cost Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) monitoring systems. These are capable of monitoring various indoor air pollutants in real-time. However, since most IAQ monitoring systems present the sensed value of the corresponding pollutant as a number, when we read the sensor values it is difficult for not experts but normal users to identify how polluted the air is or what is the pollution criteria of each pollutant. Therefore, for ambient air quality, a comprehensive Air Quality Index (AQI) is already being used in a number of nations to present the polluted level of the air, and thereby people can identify the current status of air quality easily. Nevertheless, since the index calculation is based on ambient air pollutants, and the index presents a section mean of sensed values collected for 1 or 24Â h, the AQI used for presenting ambient air quality is not suitable for IAQ representation. Therefore, in this paper, we perform an experiment that applies the AQI directly to IAQ monitoring system that we developed, and derive some problems through the result analysis.",

In comparison with other countries from Visegrad group and the EU 28 the Czech Republic reached lower results in the utilization of social networks. In two evaluated criteria from three the Czech Republic was comparable to Poland. The age groups show that with increasing age there is a declining trend for the use of social networks. 10.1{\%} of the population from 55 to 64 years and 3.3{\%} of the population over 65 use social networks in the second quarter of 2015.

In this context, big data warehouses are huge repositories of data to be used in analytics and machine learning. This work discusses models, concepts and approaches to reach scalability and realtime in big data processing and big data warehouses. The main concepts of NoSQL, Parallel Data Management Systems (PDBMS), MapReduce and Spark are reviewed in the context of scalability. The first two offering data management, the last two adding flexible and scalable processing capacities. We also turn our attention to realtime data processing, lambda architecture and its relation with scalability, and we revisit our own recent research on the issue. Three approaches are included that are directly related to realtime and scalability: the use of a realtime component in a data warehouse, parallelized de-normalization for scalability and execution tree sharing for scaling to simultaneous sessions. With these models and technologies we revisit some of the major current solutions for data management and data processing with scalability and realtime capacities.",

abstract="Modern software applications are more and more conceived as distributed service compositions deployed over Grid and Cloud technologies. Choreographies provide abstract specifications of such compositions, by modeling message-based multi-party interactions without assuming any central coordination. To enable the management and dynamic adaptation of choreographies, it is essential to keep track of events and exchanged messages and to monitor the status of the underlying platform, and combine these different levels of information into complex events meaningful at the application level. Towards this goal, we propose a Multi-source Monitoring Framework that we are developing within the EU Project CHOReOS, which can correlate the messages passed at business-service level with observations relative to the infrastructure resources. We present the monitor architecture and illustrate it on a use-case excerpted from the CHOReOS project.",

abstract="There is a growing interest in health information technology using evidence-based approaches in clinical decision-support systems, the goal for such systems is `precision medicine' using `interventional informatics'. However, the impact has been less than positive and it has been argued that interventional informatics using data-driven interventions is required to achieve evidence-based clinical decision-support. In this paper we discuss context-Aware, evidence-based, data driven development of diagnostic scales created using multi-disciplinary collaborative development. The goal is the development of novel dynamic scales for decision-support in healthcare provision and, while clinicians may derive benefit from such systems, there are potentially greater benefits for all stakeholders in medical triage systems using both face-to-face and remote consultations. While our focus lies in depression, the proposed approach will generalise to a diverse range of domains, systems, and technologies.",

Such a heterogeneity increases the complexity of merging PHR and EHR. We focus on the integration process as a main aspect for solving the heterogeneity issue. Thereby, we aim at reducing the merging complexity by defining the requirements for PHR data collection and creating an ontology for a semantically sound data-set merger for personal-centric healthcare systems and we evaluate the results with formal means.",

abstract="Nowadays, new portable devices are constantly being launched with their ever greater application to an ever growing number of domains. These devices or wearables (from wearable computing) are present in many different areas ranging from healthcare to entertainment, and provide a series of features to enhance the quality of everyday life. When used in conjunction with other wearables, they give rise to wireless body area networks (WBAN) or body area networks (BAN). The large variety of devices along with the lack of standardized services, which means that each designer or engineer must customize the API design, forces developers to implement source code mostly from scratch in order to cope with the heterogeneity of wearables and support their integration on a wider system. The result of these drawbacks is that new device integration is hampered and the time spent on the software development process is increased and these problems are addressed in this paper. We propose a model-driven approach based on a meta-model which has been designed to define and specify interaction with sensors. Our main aim is to distance developers from specific implementation and to cope with heterogeneous designs. The resulting models, which are instances of the proposed meta-model, are specified in a custom language which we call the wearable markup language (WML). We also introduce the coordinator, i.e. component-based software for handling sensor models and improving the integration of new sensors.",

abstract="Sensor network is made up of a large number of sensor nodes for communication. Some nodes can work as a gateway which transmits data to the sink. These nodes are considered as a bottleneck in multi-hop networks because they send data collected from other nodes, and hence it drains their energy quickly. This problem is known as Hot Spot problem. So, for balancing the energy throughout the network, sink and node mobility can be used. A mobile sink could collect data without the need of gateway, and hence the problem of a bottleneck in the multi-hop network can be minimized. Along with the sink, sensor nodes also can be made mobile. Energy efficiency of WSN is achieved by using mobile sensors and mobile sink with enhanced coverage, and better channel capacity. There are various routing protocols to reduce energy consumption in a mobile WSN. This review paper mainly concentrates on the study of different protocols that are used for efficient energy consumption using the mobile sink and mobile sensor nodes.",

We present models of expressive search requests and service descriptions enabling matchmaking of highly configurable services whose properties are request-dependent and dynamic. Both models are grounded in lightweight semantic formalisms of RDF and SPARQL, and use Linked Data. Our hierarchical service model provides a foundation for runtime generation of service offer descriptions, while the majority of service models and service matchmaking approaches do not sufficiently address service dynamicity aspects and operate on static service descriptions. We apply our approach to a shipping domain in order to show its feasibility for solving real world problems and its benefits for the late service binding.",

abstract="We sought to clarify the impact of information communication technology (ICT) on hospital management. We used a real-time location system for nurses' workload assessment. First, we introduced a Bluetooth-based real-time location system into a hospital and visualized the trajectories of the nursing staff from the data obtained. Next, we conducted a quantitative analysis of the data to estimate the workloads of nursing staff from the duration of stay at each bedside. We found clear differences in the time spent on care between patients in general patient rooms and those in critical care rooms. These results show the potential of using the data obtained by ICT tools to support hospital management.",

abstract="Telemedicine has been applied in disease management in many countries for a few decades. It allows delivery of medical care at a distance and helps patients to get access to medical expertise that may not be available at the patients' site; thus, it has great potential in bringing profound impact on developing countries where there is usually shortage of healthcare workforce and inadequate healthcare infrastructure. With the increase in Internet access and the trend of developing Internet of Things (IoT), Vietnam seems to have the infrastructure-ready for the application of telemedicine as one solution for the overcrowded healthcare system. The objective of this paper is to review the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine interventions especially in blood pressure control as hypertension is one of the prioritized issues in Vietnam public health system. Lessons learned from such interventions will be important for the first adoption of telemedicine in Vietnam.",

abstract="To realize remote structural health monitoring for heavy lifting appliances, e.g., 500t gantry cranes, technologies of RFID wireless sensor network, LabVIEW virtual instrument and health diagnosis expert system are empoyed to establish an integrated system. The system is divided into three layers in logic structures: the data acquisition layer, the network communication layer and the system service layer. In the data acquisition layer, RFID sensors, RFID readers are deployed to collect the structural strains, vibrations, noises and other motion parameters for each monitored object. In the system service layer, monitoring and analysis services and a health diagnose expert system are employed to carry out real-time monitoring and safety evaluation tasks. The data acquisition points connect the centre platform through LabVIEW communication tunnels. As the result of a comparison with the common optics sensing system, the proposed system has merits of wireless, easy to deploy, passive and save energy.",

abstract="Nowadays, major industry, government, and citizen initiatives are boosting the development of smart applications and services that improve the quality of life of people in domains such as mobility, security, health, and tourism, using both emerging and existing technologies. In particular, a smart tourist destination aims to improve both the citizen's quality of life and the tourist experience making use of innovation and technology. In this way, the main idea of this work is to develop a smart application focused on improving the tourist experience. The application will be based on a new concept called Smart Point of Interaction (Smart POI), the user experience research in this area, as well as a Smart POI recommendation algorithm capable of considering both user preferences and geographical influence when calculating new suggestions for users. For the experimental phase, two scenarios are considered: a simulated story and a real-world environment. In the real-world scenario, the town of Ceut{\'i} will be the first scope while for the simulated scenario, a database will be generated through surveys. As a first result, the points of interest, the target audience, and the features that will constitute the database representative of the user profile have been defined according to the real-world scenario in Ceut{\'i}. Moreover, the incorporation of an explicit feedback mechanism for the Smart POIs has been proposed as an initial approach to address user preferences.",

Then role engineering is proposed to find the appropriate roles for the RBAC system. Role mining problem, as an automatic way to find the roles, has been a hotspot for the role engineering. In this paper, we briefly introduce the basic definition of RBAC. A contribution of this paper is to classify some of the exist method into clustering methods and Binary Matrix Decomposition Method.

abstract="As populations age and chronic diseases become more prevalent, new strategies are required to help people live well. Traditional models of episodic health care will not be sufficient to meet changing health care needs and the reorientation of services towards maintaining function as opposed to treating illness. One strategy to meet these challenges is an increased focus on self-care via use of broader social networks and seamless integration of applications with lifestyle activities, particularly for people with chronic diseases including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory conditions. There has also been a rapid increase in a range of technologies for connecting different components of the health system and delivering services through smartphones and connected devices. Our proposal is to pursue systems development in healthcare in a way that considers a range of aspects known as SHARP: Sustainable, Holistic, Adaptive, Real-time and Precise. This approach will provide solutions that will be useful and effective for managing the long-term well-being of individuals.",

abstract="The Belonging Robot or BeRo, is a hybrid physical-digital art installation to develop a culture of belonging, collaboration and connectedness of the students, the professors, and the employees to their educational institution. A mobile app and in-site sensory interactions relay the collective mood of these members to the physical system by changing the system's physical configurations, in what we call the Belonging Robot (BeRo). BeRo's users interact with its physical environment using pressure sensors in the form of five different colored buttons corresponding to the five different moods of users; or, the users may choose to have their inputs through a mobile app buttons of these different moods. BeRo's configurations are to reflect the five selected moods: Very Satisfied, Satisfied, Don't Know, Somewhat Satisfied, and Not Satisfied. Based on usability engineering evaluations, we will design and prototype BeRo, to create a place for interaction between students, teachers, employees and their environment, literally HCI on environmental scale! Our platforms will be iteratively designed, prototyped and evaluated on real users. In this research, we will present BeRo's concept, motivations, scenarios of operation, architecture, and the prototype of the selected system. Finally, we will present the heuristic evaluations of BeRo from 4 experts in the field of computation, robotics, and control.",

Though the challenges to adoption of information security controls in health informatics are usually reflected on the technologies' usability aspect, they are deeply rooted on the socio-technical level involving various human factors such as the gap in the working culture, in the professional language and its implications, and in the understanding of the workflow and the operational mechanisms in the two fields - healthcare and security.

The medical industry is beckoning a quick, reliable and less expensive brain trauma diagnostic solution. Therefore, the proposed system aims to enable more timely and accurate brain health diagnostics solution, by a first-responder, non-invasive, wearable headset, which is mobile and remotely-monitored: the Computer Aided Multispectral Ultrasound Diagnostics Brain Health Monitoring System.

abstract="Healthcare using Mobile devices and Cloud Computing is an emergent topic of interest in both industry and research. Though ubiquity of mobile devices and availability of e-Health record plays an important role to enhance health care quality and services, it introduces several challenges too such as, limited power of mobile devices, privacy and anonymity of patient data, the reliability of end user, interoperability and availability of e-Health records, etc. Under HIPAA regulations, healthcare data needs to be secured from unsolicited disclosure when sharing among multiple medical service providers. In this paper, we focus on exchanging healthcare data among doctor and patient's healthcare service providers. We develop an android mobile application and a Cloud service to exchange patient's data among authorized users in a secure and privacy-preserving manner. The cloud service that we developed performs cryptographic computations, communicates with mobile application and also overcomes the limitations of mobile devices. We evaluate our proposed solution using real-world data set. The performance analysis proves the efficiency of our application. Privacy analysis of our proposed solution depicts that our system is secure and protects the privacy of healthcare data.",

abstract="Remote healthcare centers located in sub-Saharan of Africa are still facing a shortage of healthcare practitioners, yielding long queue of patients in waiting rooms during several hours. This situation increases the risk that critical patients are consulted too late, motivating the importance of priority-based patient scheduling systems. This paper presents the design of a Multi-Priority Triage Chair (MPTC) to be installed at the entrance of patient's waiting rooms such that each new patient first sits in the MPTC to measure its vital signs and register his/her other priority parameters such as arrival time, travel time or distance between the concerned center and its home, and so on. The proposed MPTC will then update in real-time the consultation planning in order to statistically minimize (i) the number of critical patients not treated within a pre-defined waiting time, (ii) the number of patients waiting for more than a pre-defined period and (iii) the number of patients living relatively far who gets their consultation postponed to another day.",

Evaluation for changeable systems like context-aware and specially developed for AmI environments needs to be conducted to assess the impact and awareness of the users. E-Health represents a challenging domain where users(patients, patients' relatives and healthcare professionals) are very sensitive to systems' response. If system failure occurs it can conducts to a bad diagnosis or medication, or treatment. So a user-centred evaluation system is need to provide the system with users' feedback.

Nonetheless, current solutions focus on presenting data and target at individual health metrics and not intelligent recommendations. In order to advance the state-of-the-art, there is a demand for models that correlate mobile sensor data, health parameters, and situational and/or social environment. We seek to improve current models by combining environmental monitoring, personal data collecting, and predictive analytics. For that, we introduce a middleware called Device Nimbus that provides the structures to integrate data from sensors in existing mobile computing technology. Moreover, it includes the algorithms for context inference and recommendation support. This development leads to innovative solutions in continuous health monitoring, based on recommendations contextualised in the situation and social environment. In this paper we propose a model, position it against state-of-the-art, and outline a proof-of-concept implementation.",

abstract="This paper presents an approach to estimate the remaining useful life of sensors. First, a system state machine is defined to divide the sampled data received from the sensors into different categories. Then, the sampled data sets are sent to the fault model to detect whether a fault has occurred. The time of occurrence for each type of fault is recorded and weighted with different coefficient. The weighted values are accumulated to form a trend data graph. An exponential curve fitting is then used to approximate the trend of data to determine the remaining useful life function and threshold is also generated from the cumulative faults value. The experimental results shows the proposed model has a precision of 66.67{\%} and recall rate near 100{\%} within 10-h timespan. Thus, the proposed model may not only prolong the life span of sensors, but may also reduce the cost to replace them.",

For demonstration, we transmitted electrocardiogram signal from Li-Fi transmitter to receiver and the performance has been analysed for various transmission distances. Further enhancement of this work has been proposed as an all-optical health monitoring system that is suitable for hospital environment. In hospitals, VLC is the efficient wireless data communication technology in health monitoring. VLC ensures secured, faster way of communication and use of unlicensed visible spectrum. This enhanced scheme uses biomedical sensors that detect specific biological, chemical, or physical changes that occur in a patient's body. Biological data are transmitted by an array of LEDs.

Detecting and monitoring these activities of interest result in both application-specific benefits and operational benefits. However, human activities often overlap, thereby making activity detection from the collected sensor events a challenging problem. In this paper, we first present the various benefits of such materialization of sensor events into activities, and then discuss the challenges in detecting diverse activities taken up by humans. More interestingly, the diversity of human activities and the time-variability of a given activity by the same human, makes reliable detection of activities even harder, and open up interesting avenues for future research.",

abstract="In recent years, Data Mining techniques such as classification, clustering, association, regression etc. are widely used in healthcare field to help analyzing and predicting disease and improving the quality and efficiency of medical services. This paper presents a web-based platform for big data analysis of healthcare using Data Mining techniques. The platform consists of three main layers: Apache Spark Layer, Workflow Layer and Web Service Layer. Apache Spark Layer provides basic Apache Spark functionalities as regular Resilient Distributed Datasets (RDD) operations. Meanwhile, this layer provides a cache mechanism to maximize the use of the results as much as possible which were calculated before. Workflow Layer encapsulates a variety of nodes for Data Mining, which have different roles such as data source, algorithm model or evaluation tool. These nodes can be organized into a workflow which is a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and then it will be submitted to Apache Spark Layer to execute. And we have implemented many models including Na{\"i}ve Bayes model, Decision Tree model and Logistic Regression model etc. for healthcare big data. Web Service Layer implements rich restful API including data uploading, workflow composition and analysis task submission. We also provide a web graphical interface for the user. Through the interface users can achieve efficient Data Mining without any programming which can greatly help the medical staff who don't understand programming to diagnose the patients' condition more accurately and efficiently.",

abstract="Most medical centers in Taiwan implement the reduction of ``D2B'' time, which is defined as the time interval between an Acute Myocardial Infarction (AMI) patient arrives at hospital and he/she receives primary percutaneous coronary intervention. The patient's Electrocardiogram (ECG) must be confirmed by a cardiologist and made sure the patient really has AMI. For the confirmation, the cardiologists must access a PC, connect it to the intranet of the hospital and employ the special PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) image browser before he/she can diagnose the ECG. But this will prolong the D2B time since PC, the browser and/or network may be currently unavailable. In this paper, we introduce a system with which cardiologists can directly utilize their smart phones to browse the patient's ECG after receiving the short message service (SMS) text issued by his/her hospital so as to avoid the mentioned problem and shorten the D2B time.",

Losing their everyday independence is a major concern for the elderly, partly because they fear this could lead to an involuntary move to an assisted living facility instead of living independently. Since 2015, the Dutch government encourages their citizens to age-in-place, but at the same time struggles with how to implement new healthcare regulations. To support both government and citizens, we propose a digital platform to match supply and demand in the health and wellbeing domain. Such a platform should not only enable end-users to enhance self-management, but also support them to find solutions for everyday problems related to aging-in-place. To illustrate our Action Design Research we established a Living Lab in a metropolitan area in the Netherlands, and developed a prototype of the proposed platform in a real-life setting.",

abstract="We present an intelligent data management framework that can facilitate development of highly scalable and mobile healthcare applications for remote monitoring of patients. This is achieved through the use of a global log data abstraction that leverages the storage and processing capabilities of the edge devices and the cloud in a seamless manner. In existing log based storage systems, data is read as fixed size chunks from the cloud to enhance performance. However, in healthcare applications, where the data access pattern of the end users differ widely, this approach leads to unnecessary storage and cost overheads. To overcome these, we propose dynamic log chunking. The experimental results, comparing existing fixed chunking against the H-Plane model, show 13Â {\%}--19Â {\%} savings in network bandwidth as well as cost while fetching the data from the cloud.",

abstract="Ensuring machine health and predicting failures beforehand is of utmost importance. Fog networking is an emerging paradigm of computing. Advances in neural networks research and their benefits in accurate classification make them best candidate for application to prognostics. Ubiquity of smartphones, wearables and sensors is giving rise to tremendous amount of data necessitating intelligent data analytics at the data center. Various researches have focused on compression of large deep models for inferencing on smart devices in order to seek answers to issues like reducing the enormity of computation, decreasing the power and memory requirements on these devices. At this point in time, state of the art in inference such as recurrent neural networks (RNN) seem impossible to be implemented on resource constrained devices. Cloud based inference incurs cost in terms of power as more energy is depleted to access infrastructure via technologies such as 3g/4g networks while also witnessing latency issues due to network congestion. A few real world situations offload inferencing to network edge as it is more beneficial to solve many issues like security, privacy of users, redundancy rather than uploading enormous volume of data on cloud. The paradigm, known as Fog Computing, is a hot topic in research facilitating edge analytics by overcoming constraints and shortcoming of cloud enabling quality of service (QoS) required in some real world applications such as Industrial Internet of Things (IoT). Fog acts as a medium between edge device and cloud. In this paper, we propose a hybrid approach of using Fog in conjunction with deep neural nets for inferencing. We propose how neural nets exploited by Fog/Cloudlet can provide computational and storage services to nearby devices and it will also put a barrier by filtering the voluminous data to a reduced form for cloud.",

In particular, we first introduce our detailed methodology for security analysis, including log analysis, Hook technology, and Android reverse engineering. Then, we apply it to popular commercial smartbands of three different brands the concrete information of which is omitted, identify their common vulnerabilities, and develop accordingly a fake Android application (App) utilizing the identified loopholes, given the protection measures of shelling, obfuscation, as well as forcible pairing and resetting. By installing the fake App, we are able to conduct deception attacks against the targeted smartbands, succeeding to remotely activate/deactivate shaking function, to adjust/modify time (including value and format), and to obtain the smartband owner's sensitive/health data. During our deception attacks, no cooperation from the smartband owner is required, neither the pairing process between the targeted smartbands and our fake App.",

These devices are considered as ``smart'' devices because they may be able to communicate with each other or with the Internet. However, they are not ``smart'' enough in a sense of learning. Most of the time, users have to manually interact with the devices to match their living style. This paper proposes a distributed machine learning method to automate the learning process for these devices to avoid making users repeat the manual interaction over and over again. Each device is able to self-learn to detect users' favorite settings during certain periods and then share this information among other self-learning smart devices to find patterns that may lead to the best combination of their settings that suit the living style of each member of the house. It implements a distributed classifier system that resulted in an algorithm that is small enough to run on lightweight single-board computers.",

Although, a lot of research is being conducted in order to develop more efficient stream data mining techniques, pre-processing of stream data is an area that is under-studied. Real time applications generate data which is rather noisy and contain missing values. Apart from this, there is the issue of data evolution, which is a concern when dealing with stream data. To deal with the evolution of data, the proposed solution offers a hybrid of preprocessing techniques which are adaptive in nature.

abstract="The IoT and Pocket Labs are popular buzzwords today with the IoT being much better known in wider circles, while the Pocket Labs is a relatively new concept offering new teaching opportunities which are to be further explored and analyzed. Although the IoT {\&} Pocket Labs are not necessarily interconnected or mutually conditioned, this paper discusses such a real case of teaching practice, where the Pocket Labs are a natural solution for teaching of IoT. The paper deals with one semester teaching experience of IoT as a university course. Obtained results and experience may be quite general except for university students profile defined with their previous education and knowledge. Besides the main goal of the course which is an introduction to IoT, some other aims were exploring the social impact of IoT and emphasizing the importance of new original ideas and views being as important as mastering the IoT technologies.",

abstract="Testbeds and experimental network facilities accelerate the expansion of disruptive Internet services and support their evolution. The integration of IoT technologies in the context of Unmanned Vehicles (UxVs) and their deployment in federated, real--world testbeds introduce various challenging research issues. This paper presents the Semantic Aggregate Manager (SAM) that exploits semantic technologies for modeling and managing resources of federated IoT Testbeds. SAM introduces new semantics--based features tailored to the needs of IoT enabled UxVs, but on the same time allows the compatibility with existing legacy, ``de facto'' standardised protocols, currently utilized by multiple federated testbed management systems. The proposed framework is currently being deployed in order to be evaluated in real--world testbeds across several sites in Europe.",

abstract="Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) have been applied in many different areas. Data transmission quality of service (QoS) has become a hot research point for the WSN, especially for the emergency data. Many researchers focused on developing WSN access and routing algorithms for the transmission of QoS, but less research has been focused on the mobile user equipment (UE) acting as a gateway for WSN data transmission. In this chapter, we propose a UE-gateway-assisted adaptive transmission algorithm for the WSN, which designs a new signaling to select the UE-gateway as the access point. Simulation results show that the WSN system energy cost and data transmission delay can achieve a better system performance by using the adaptive scheme compared to the traditional scheme.",

However, the trust in these IoT applications is severely compromised by security concerns. We introduce a lightweight and effective security approach for such applications by protecting the sensors. Our approach leverages Physically Unclonable Functions (PUF) on the sensor platform to ensure non-repudiation of sensed data and integrity of sensor hardware and firmware. We compare the performance of different PUF implementations on Atmel, ARM, and FPGA-based sensing platforms, analyze the security properties of the proposed protocols and determine the overhead in terms of latency, storage and logic area. Our evaluation shows that it only incurs insignificant overhead on low-end sensors.",

In this paper, we attempt to further enhance the quality of modularity optimization by mining local close-knit structures. First, both periphery and core close-knit structures are defined, and several fast mining and merging algorithms are presented. Second, a novel Fast Newman (FN) algorithm named NFN incorporating local structures into global optimization is proposed. Experimental results in terms of both internal and external on six real-world social networks have demonstrated the effectiveness of NFN on community detection.",

abstract="The virtual forms present dynamically generated visual images containing information that influences a users behavior and thinking. In a typical way, adding a display to show visual expressions or projecting some information on an artifact offers computational visual forms on the existing daily artifacts. Using virtual forms is a very promising way to enhance artifacts surrounding us, and to make our daily life and business richer and more enjoyable. We believe that incorporating fictional stories into virtual forms offers a new possibility for enriching user experiences. In particular, integrating fictional stories into our daily activities through transmedia storytelling is a promising approach. Transmedia storytelling enables virtual forms to be employed everywhere to immersively integrate fictional stories into our daily activities. If we can design attractive virtual forms in a structured way, it will become easy to enrich user experiences. Currently, the design framework for virtual forms is not well defined. The framework needs to take into account the semiotic aspect of a virtual form. One key factor, in particular, is how strongly we believe in the reality of a fictional story within the virtual form. In this paper, we show the extracted insights discussed in the workshops and present some design implications for designing virtual forms that integrate fictional stories into our daily activities.",

abstract="At present, the environment of agricultural production faces reduced productivity due to population decline and aging population, and agricultural products may be stolen anytime. To solve such problems, researchers have studied IoT-based smart farms. A smart farm is a system for enabling users to manage and control agricultural crops anytime anywhere on the basis of IoT (Internet of Things). This study aims to examine a system for preventing agricultural product theft by using an image monitoring system, for example, CCTV, which is part of the smart farm 1st model functions. First, the system uses image information inputted by the image monitoring system to detect objects loitering agricultural crops, and then uses directional change information to determine objects loitering the crops as abnormal behaviors. The system then uses the single-board computer, Raspberry Pi, to output real-time warning sounds and send the information of the object determined as abnormal behaviors to the user to prevent agricultural product theft.",

These are drawn upon to elaborate the inherently social and relational character of data and the challenges this poses for the ongoing development of HDI, particularly with respect to the `articulation' of personal data.

This paper presents a prosumer tool called DataQuest to gather and analyze data from an AmI platform based on ontologies using simple services. An empirical study was carried out in order to demonstrate that, based on the defined prosumer model; a domain expert can create services with acceptable quality for a given domain. The authors performed a case study where 24 people used the prosumer tool to create simple services over a prosumer infrastructure for retrieving and analyzing data from a semantic AmI platform; the aim of this study consists of analyzing the quality of the services built and studying the effort needed to build prosumer services compared with traditional development.",

The ``Internet of Things'' spreads across all industries transforming isolated production cells to members of large communication, logistic and manufacturing systems. But not only production, also the preceding engineering processes suffer from rigid procedural workflows, hierarchically dominated decision-making structures and numerous media breaks. It is therefore inevitable to include the product development within this new concept of ``Industry 4.0'', linking real and virtual products to the manufacturing world. The aim is to generate structures and descriptions of products, which define a new product completely in digital terms, so that it becomes transparent and understandable in all its facets both in the initial stage of formation as well as to its future. A digital image or model, also called virtual twin, therefore, must be digitally accessible in all product life stages to all stakeholders and actors, who are dealing with the product, so as to maintain service quality and functionality even under changed conditions.

In mobile cloud computing (MCC) environment, mobile devices suffer from less battery power when performing operation for longer duration. To overcome this problem, in this work, an energy-efficient mechanism for computation in mobile devices named as Mobile to Cloud (M2C) is proposed. In this approach, offloading the resource-intensive computation is done by the cloud. M2C can reduce the overall latency for processing various kinds of data from the mobile devices by considering a cloudlet layer. The simulation results indicate that the execution time of applications is improved by M2C as compared to without using cloudlet layer.",

The ability of gathering information regarding the handled objects and their surroundings with the help of appropriate sensors is essential for the correct functioning of such a system. Existing systems with optical sensors already provide impressive results, but there is still room for improvement regarding reliability, dynamic and diversity of their processes. This article proposes a system concept which provides the desired information and resolves the described problems. It works with an RFID-transponder, which is attached to the object, a suitable locating procedure as well as an optical sensor technology and appropriate data analysis. In order to implement this system there is need for further research. It is especially necessary to develop appropriate locating procedures and real time analysis algorithms.",

abstract="With the increasing scale of SaaS and the continuous growth in server failures, task scheduling problems become more intricate, and both scheduling quality and scheduling speed raise further concerns. In this paper, we first propose a virtualized and monitoring SaaS model with predictive maintenance to minimize the costs of fault tolerance. Then with the monitored and predicted available states of servers, we focus on dynamic real-time task scheduling in large-scale heterogeneous SaaS, targeting at jointly optimizing the long-term performance benefits and energy costs in order to improve scheduling quality. We formulate a dynamic programming problem, where both the state and action spaces are too large to be solved by simple iterations. To address these issues, we take advantage of Machine Learning theory, and put forward an approximate dynamic programming algorithm. We utilize value function approximation and candidate-heuristic method to separately solve state and action explosions. Thus, computation complexity is significantly reduced and scheduling speed is greatly enhanced. Finally, we conduct experiments with both random simulation data and Google cloud trace-logs. Qos evaluations and comparisons demonstrate that our approach is effective and efficient under bursty requests and high throughputs.",

The handling conditions and temperature changes can significantly decrease the shelf life and cause faster spoilage of food. The study presents two examples of shelf life prediction. The first one is based on temperature measurements of fish covered with ice in a Styrofoam box with supported information of environment temperatures in the cold store, uncooled car and refrigerator. In the second, measurements from first phase of storage on temperatures (0Â {\textdegree}C--4Â {\textdegree}C) were used with assumption of fish stored later on higher temperatures without ice.

abstract="Nowadays, humanity is surrounded by many technological devices that are connected to the Internet (sensors, smart meters, etc.). These devices can transmit and receive data automatically via interfaces for wireless transmission of data, thus generating Machine-to-Machine (M2M) traffic. This massive connectivity provides attractive new services, usually transmitting fragments of small data. This is especially true for Long-Term Evolution (LTE), which was originally optimized for users Human-to-Human (H2H). The main problem caused by the introduction of M2M applications is the congestion that occurs at the access network because of the tremendous number of devices that attempt to simultaneously access the network. This article provides M2M communication methods based on the 3GPP standard. In this paper we consider concurrent access to radio resources in a M2M/H2H coexistence scenario based on a dynamic random access algorithm for LTE network. This work studies the impact of M2M terminals massively and simultaneously attempting to have a random access to LTE. First, we emphasize the problem of resources sharing by MTC devices. Then we assess the impact of the introduction of M2M services on the performance of applications H2H according to throughput metric.",

At present, citizens and companies quite often have to create an individual account for almost every government application to share or exchange information. Enabling ``bring your own identity'' (ByoID) for eGovernment means that access management (AM) will gradually converge to create a single, user-friendly approach in the future. From a technical point of view, many of the necessary features and protocols already exist but have not yet been widely implemented in eGovernment environments. This poses a very complex challenge, both from an operational point of view and from an IT governance and compliance perspective. The only way to solve this is close collaboration among citizens, the private sector and the government. The basis will be an identity and access management (IAM) system that can be adapted to the comprehensive requirements resulting from the aforementioned collaboration. In this article, we describe the path the Swiss government has taken for establishing such a flexible IAM system from the IT providers' perspective while respecting security and privacy requirements.",

To achieve it, we included the model in a 16-week class to design hybrid games. In this paper, we detailed model usage in course schedule, and discussed how students experienced it. Besides, we presented student's six working prototypes, including design cycles, and playtesting sessions. After class, we conducted semi-structured interviews with student's representatives. Results revealed model usefulness to describe the system setup and interface elements. Furthermore, according to students, the model vocabulary facilitated communication among team members.

abstract="Laboratory courses form an integral part of electrical and electronic engineering curriculum necessary for equipping students with skills and ability to solve problems in real-world contexts. However, students often feel frustrated and demotivated while conducting certain experiments in laboratories due to hindrances like inability to debug circuits and lack of theoretical and practical knowledge. Students often come unprepared to the time-bound laboratory assignments with insufficient pre-reading and sometimes require continuous assistance from their instructors to perform theÂ experiments in practical laboratory sessions. This paper presents an initial stage in developing heuristics for embedding intelligence into electronics engineering laboratory-based learning artefacts in a pervasive and ubiquitous computing scenario. Such artefacts can be tools and equipment like breadboards, voltmeter, digital power supply, etc., used in laboratories. An empirical study was conducted to understand the type of intelligence needed to be embedded into such objects in context of electrical and electronic engineering laboratories to improve learning experience of students by minimizing their cognitive load. Data was collated qualitatively from studies involving student feedbacks. Semi-structured interviews of undergraduate students and subject matter experts (SMEs) were carried out. Based on the study and data analysis, potential areas where interventions can be made have been identified and presented in this paper. Their potential to become a basis of formulating and embedding intelligence in the next stage is outlined.",

Such ontologies may help to cope with the problems of sensor discovery, data integration, and re-use, but need to be used in conjunction with algorithms for sensor selection and ranking. This paper describes a method for selecting and ranking sensors based on the requirements of predictive models. It discusses a Viticulture use case that demonstrates the complexity of semantic modelling and reasoning for the automated ranking of sensors according to the requirements on environmental variables as input to predictive analytical models.

Knowledge barriers in the way of adequate agents' participation in the dynamic environment of dynamic network business process (DNBP) and knowledge-intensive business process (KiBP) requiring better developed knowledge acquisition methods and information support are examined. As a result of the research, the fundamental reason for the knowledge barriers existence is given, and the organizational and dynamic factors which increase damage caused by barriers are provided. The paper describes the priority set of knowledge elicitation, structurization, and representation methods oriented towards knowledge workers, domain experts, or other human agents for organizing agents' cooperation. The paper suggests the framework of methods aimed at requirements of DNBP and KiBP.",

abstract="Personalization of online content creates filter bubbles and reinforces echo chambers. These are driven not only by natural human behaviours but also by design choices and efficiency-driven recommender systems. The traditional media policy goal of exposing citizens to diverse information to protect pluralism has not found its concrete application on social media. As the usage of social media as a news source increases, as well as personalization' sophistication and group polarization, there is a need for preventing audience fragmentation. The paper suggests serendipity as a potential design principle and, eventually, policy goal. Indeed, serendipity -- considered both as a capability and a process of seeking and processing unexpected and valuable information -- requires diverse information as a precondition and it causes cognitive diversity. Serendipity as a design principle might encompass fundamental phases of production and consumption of information, representing a positive freedom valuable from an epistemological, psychological and political perspective. With serendipity being both limited and cultivated in the digital environment, the research reveals a theoretical trade-off between relevance and serendipity (or unknown relevance) that might be tackled with serendipity-driven recommender systems and structural and informational nudging. Such approach could turn the media policy goal of exposing users to diverse information towards an experience of diversity that comes through an architecture for serendipity.",

abstract="Emerging indoor positioning and WiFi infrastructure enable building apps with numerous Location-based Services (LBS) that represent critical threats to smartphone users' location privacy provoking continuous tracking, profiling and unauthorized identification. Currently, the app eco-system relies on permission-based access control, which is proven ineffective at controlling how third party apps and/or library developers use and share users' data. In this paper we present the design, deployment and evaluation of PL-Protector, a location privacy-enhancing middleware, which through a caching technique minimises the interaction and data collection from wireless access points, content distributors and location providers. PL-Protector also provides a new series of control settings and privacy rules over both, the information and control flows between sources and sinks, to prevent user information disclosure during LBS queries. We implement PL-Protector on Android 6, and conduct experiments with real apps from five different categories of location-based services such as instant messaging and navigation. Experiments demonstrate acceptable delay overheads (lower than 22Â ms) within practical limits; hence, our middleware is practical, secure and efficient for location-demanding apps.",

abstract="Communication technologies have revolutionized modern society. They have changed the way we do business, travel, manage our personal lives and communicate with our friends. In many cases, this crucially depends on accurate and reliable authentication. We need to get authenticated in order to get access to restricted services and/or places (i.e. transport systems, e-banking, border control). This authentication is performed in constrained settings due to: (i) privacy issues, (ii) noisy conditions, (iii) resource constraints. Privacy-preservation is essential for the protection of sensitive information (i.e. diseases, location, nationality). Noisy conditions refer to physical noise in the communication channel that may lead to modification of the transmitted information, or natural variability due to the authentication medium (e.g. fingerprint scans). Resource constraints refer to limited device power/abilities (i.e. sensors, RFID tags). It is a very challenging problem to develop privacy-preserving authentication for noisy and constrained environments that optimally balance authentication accuracy, privacy-preservation and resource consumption. In this paper, we describe the main challenges of the problem of authentication in constrained settings, the current state-of-the-art of the field and possible directions of research.",

abstract="Classifying realistic human actions in video remains challenging for existing intro-variability and inter-ambiguity in action classes. Recently, Spatial-Temporal Interest Point (STIP) based local features have shown great promise in complex action analysis. However, these methods have the limitation that they typically focus on Bag-of-Words (BoW) algorithm, which can hardly discriminate actions' ambiguity due to ignoring of spatial-temporal occurrence relations of visual words. In this paper, we propose a new model to capture this contextual relationship in terms of pairwise features' co-occurrence. Normalized Google-Like Distance (NGLD) is proposed to numerically measuring this co-occurrence, due to its effectiveness in semantic correlation analysis. All pairwise distances compose a NGLD correlogram and its normalized form is incorporated into the final action representation. It is proved a much richer descriptor by observably reducing action ambiguity in experiments, conducted on WEIZMANN dataset and the more challenging UCF sports. Results also demonstrate the proposed model is more effective and robust than BoW on different setups.",

abstract="Increasingly research interests within the area of pervasive and ubiquitous computing, such as activity recognition, rely upon storage and retrieval of sensor data. Due to the increase in volume, velocity and variation of such sensor data its storage and retrieval has become a big data problem. There are a number of current platforms that are intended to store large amount of sensor data, however, they lack research oriented features. To address these deficiencies this study introduces a research oriented, device agnostic sensor, data platform called SensorCentral. This platform incorporates several research oriented features such as offering annotation interfaces, metric generation, exporting experimental datasets, machine learning services, rule based classification, forwarding live sensor records to other systems and quick sensor configuration. The current main installation of this platform has been in place for over 18 months, has been successfully associated with 6 sensor classes from 13 vendors and currently holds over 500 million records. Future work will involve offering this platform to other researchers and incorporating direct integration with the Open Data Initiative enabling better collaboration with other researchers on an international scale.",

For monitoring life-log, the knowledge of sedentary behavior first need to be formulated by the domain expert in the form of unhealthy situations, these situations are used as the monitoring unit. In this study we proposed a method for automatically monitoring users' unhealthy situations in the domain of sedentary behavior with prolonged activities. The proposed method simultaneously filters out multiple sedentary activities of users simultaneously while ignoring the activities having no situations. The results depict that the monitoring method intimates the stakeholder with delay less than the monitoring interval cycle.",

abstract="For impaired people, the conduction of certain daily life activities is problematic due to motoric and cognitive handicaps. For that reason, assistive agents in ambient assisted environments provide services that aim at supporting elderly and impaired people. However, these agents act in complex stochastic and indeterministic environments where the concrete effects of a performed action are usually unknown at design time. Furthermore, they have to perform varying tasks according to the user's context and needs, wherefore an agent has to be flexible and able to recognize required capabilities in a certain situation in order to provide adequate, unobtrusive assistance. Hence, an expressive representation framework is required that relates user-specific impairments to required agent capabilities. This work presents an approach which (a)Â describes and links user impairments and capabilities using the formal, model-theoretic semantics expressed in OWL2Â DL ontologies, (b)Â computes optimal policies through Reinforcement Learning and propagates these in an agent network. The presented approach improves the collaborative, personalized and adequate assistance of assistive agents and tailors the agent-based services to the user's missing capabilities.",

abstract="Current demographic trends indicate that there is a growing number of older population groups worldwide, which is associated with an increase of chronic neurological disorders such as Parkinson's disease, which burden the country's healthcare system. Therefore there is an urgent call for developing efficient strategies which could reduce the healthcare costs and meet the demand of older ill people at affordable cost. One of such approaches is the use of mobile devices and applications. The purpose of this study is to explore mobile devices and/or mobile applications which are used in the assessment, management and treatment of Parkinson's disease. The methods used in this study include a literature review of available sources found in the world's acknowledged databases Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and ScienceDirect, as well as the methods of comparison and evaluation of the findings from the selected studies were applied. The findings show that mobile devices and smart-based apps can serve as an appropriate assessment, diagnostic, monitoring and treatment tools for patients with PD since they are relatively cost-effective, reliable and non-invasive. However, more research has to be done in the area of their use in the treatment of PD symptoms, as well as more randomized controlled trials with larger samples of subjects should be conducted.",

Many research works have been focusing on the wireless communication level to obtain quality of service. This paper widens the problem, and provides a comprehensive system design, where it covers all the elements in a remote health monitoring application. The system collects measurements in a relational database, either through a C{\#}.NET or a LabVIEW program. The end-user is able to observe either real-time data (i.e. with insignificant delay) or processed historical data on any web browser. We have shown that the inclusion of the relational database may impose a need for the data to be buffered before inserting into the database within a single transaction, but the buffering does not entail delays bigger than 50 ms.",

The potential consequences of this phenomena are examined in the specific circumstances of `ambient assisted living' as an instantiation of the concept of `intelligent environment'. This chapter describes the idea of `ambient assisted living' and looks at some of the possible ways humans may be affected by the prevalence of technology. The general example of assisted healthcare, and the specific example of medication support are used to show that systems are advancing. Moreover, these advancements can lead to problems with both the artificial systems, and the larger systems with which they are involved. In many cases there is a trade-off around having people in the loop, but inevitably they will need to be included for many decision making processes. Keeping a person in the loop might also partially redress problems of Artificial General Intelligence systems. The chapter concludes with reflections on how these considerations can help us to retain the positive aspects whilst avoiding the negative side effects of the hypothetical technological singularity.",

This same challenge is present when considering new devices for visualization, such as Head Mounted Displays -HDM (e.g. Google Glass). Advanced interfaces such as Augmented Reality (AR) and Head-Up Display (HUD) provide a means to display these information for users. However, there is still a lack of theoretical design studies (studies that do not consider current technologies limitations) of Augmented Reality and HUD. Another problem in industrial scenarios is motivation, especially considering repetitive procedural works.

abstract="This paper argues that there is a need for an awareness and education about privacy literacy in an age where lifelogging technologies are ubiquitous and open up private data to commercial and other uses, wherein commercial entities build up huge digital libraries of private data that they then mine with big data analytics. Often, data is represented as if they are the raw material of information and algorithms, and as neutral agents for processing these pieces of information, but in our digital society, this so-called neutral data can become open data that can be processed easily to reveal informational metadata on individuals' behaviors. Whilst much of this may be beyond individual control, and simply an unavoidable part of our information society, there are certain types of personal and private data that can be, and need to be, under individual control, and not open to integration or `hashing' with public data. This requires a new type of data literacy on the part of users that we term as privacy literacy.",

abstract="Patient's motion recognition is quite popular in the area of healthcare and medical service nowadays. By analyzing the data from variant sensors within the network, we can estimate the activities a person does. The analyzing job is usually done by a classifier which can classify each motion into one category with similar movements. Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a kind of algorithm that can be used to arrange data into different categories without any guidance. Decision tree is a mature tool for classification. In this paper, we propose a new kind of classification method with data from BAN called SOM-Decision Tree. Firstly, we use SOM on each of the sensor nodes to categorize motions into different classes, so that motions in different classes can be distinguished by this sensor. Secondly, a decision tree is constructed to discriminate each kind of movements from other motions. Finally, any action of the same patient can be recognized by query through the decision tree. According to our experiment, this algorithm is feasible and quite efficient.",

abstract="This paper proposes using a commodity-based smartwatch paired with a smartphone for developing a fall detection IoT application which is non-invasive and privacy preserving. The majority of current fall detection applications require specially designed hardware and software which make them expensive and inaccessible to the general public. We demonstrated that by collecting accelerometer data from a smartwatch and processing those data in a paired smartphone, it is possible to reliability detect (93.8{\%} accuracy) whether a person has encountered a fall in real-time. By wearing a smartwatch as a piece of jewelry, the well-being of a person can be monitored in real-time at anytime and anywhere as contrasted to being confined in a particular facility installed with special sensors and cameras. Using simulated fall data acquired from volunteers, we trained a fall detection model off-line that can be composed with a data collection accessor to continuously analyze accelerometer data gathered from a smartwatch to detect minor or serious fall at anytime and anywhere. The accessor-based architecture allows easy composition of the fall-detection IoT application tailored to heterogeneity of devices and variation of user's need.",

abstract="Socially intelligent virtual agents are a promising solution to the increasing challenges of eldercare. This article describes an autonomous conversational agent system, simulating human-like affective behaviour to act as a daily life companion for older adults living at home. We present results from a user-centred design study that informed the design of the companion. The interaction with the user is based on a multimodal interface including automatic speech recognition, text-to-speech, and a graphical touch-based user interface. The companion offers support to older adults by locating objects, offering reminders, and guidance with household activities. It also supports emergency detection and handling. We present the companion's architecture and key components as well as the affective interaction paradigm and its implementation in the multimodal user interface. We conducted an exploratory evaluation study where the companion was introduced in 20 homes of older adults (aged 65+) in two EU countries. For a total duration of 12Â weeks, various scenarios were tested, covering different types of interactions and tasks that occur in daily life. Qualitative and quantitative data on acceptance, perceived usability, and usefulness yield rich information on how agents perform in real-world settings and which factors influence their success in this context. We reflect on the results of the evaluation study in terms of lessons learned and discuss future opportunities for fellow researchers who are striving to bring virtual agents out of the laboratories into successful real world applications.",

abstract="In our previous study, we have reviewed the existing criteria from different design domains that seem as relevant for the design and assessment of the wearables. Our next goal is developing a Universal Design-based assessment framework, which should cover all three layers of the Universal Design model: the transcending principle, process-related principles, and human factors principles. The equity principle says that an application of design is universally inclusive for all kinds of different users. We propose starting an evaluation with the assessment of equity, using a revised version of the guidelines of the National Institute of Health for Equality Impact Assessment. The process-related principles include flexibility, error-management, efficiency, and stability and predictability. For these principles, we propose the use of well-established usability evaluation tools with focusing on the principles listed above. For the evaluation of human factors principles, which include ergonomic, perception and cognition principles, we propose the use of the Inclusive Design Toolkit developed by the Engineering Design Centre of the University of Cambridge. A combination of mentioned above three tools can provide a comprehensive and fast evaluation framework for wearables and other types of design artifacts, which do not have interactions with screen-based input/output devices.",

abstract="Gradual patterns aim at automatically extracting co-variations between variables of data sets in the form of ``the more/the less'' such as ``the more experience, the higher salary''. This data mining method has been applied more and more in finding knowledge recently. However, gradual patterns are still not applicable on spatial data while such information have strong presence in many application domains. For instance, in our work we consider the issue of potentially avoidable hospitalizations. Their determinants have been studied to improve the quality, efficiency, and equity of health care delivery. Although the statistical methods such as regression method can find the associations between the increased potentially avoidable hospitalizations with its determinants such as lower density of ambulatory care nurses, there is still a challenge to identify how the geographical areas follow or not the tendencies. Therefore, in this paper, we propose to extend gradual patterns to the management of spatial data. Our work is twofold. First we propose a methodology for extracting gradual patterns at several hierarchical levels. In addition, we introduce a methodology for visualizing this knowledge. For this purpose, we rely on spatial maps for allowing decision makers to easily notice how the areas follow or not the gradual patterns. Our work is applied to the measure of the potentially avoidable hospitalizations to prove its interest.",

abstract="ICT has a significant role in the development and production of municipal services, and in the daily work of municipal civil servants. Yet, municipalities typically develop and operate their ICT activities independently with limited ICT resources, both money and people. Limited resources are the key incentive for inter-municipal ICT cooperation. This article investigates how ICT cooperation is carried out within 20 municipal regions. As the theoretical basis we review transaction cost economics (TCE), resource based view (RBV) and the constructs of Granovetter's social network theory. They are used to outline potential economic and social benefits emerging from ICT cooperation and to describe social mechanisms that influence the realization of such benefits. Our empirical data reveals that there are distinct differences in the effectiveness of ICT activities, in the amount of ICT cooperation and in the governance of ICT cooperation. Our analysis reveals that the emperor will not have clothes -- ICT cooperation benefits -- unless the cooperation is properly organized and governed.",

Traditional resource-centric services computing paradigm tries to make use of mass customization approaches to fulfill customer demands in a cost-effective way, but sacrifices the personalization degree and decreases customer satisfaction. We propose a user-centric paradigm called ``Personal Service Eco-Environment (PSE2)'' which plays as a ``personal assistant'' of each user. PSE2 is composed of personal data, services, and social relations around a user, and fully-personalized service/social collaboration solutions are to be planned on the basis of the individualized characteristics extracted from his personal data and the dynamic multi-end context.

Implementation of effective countermeasures necessitates an advanced understanding of emerging security challenges and transformational concepts conjoining nexus of S{\&}T and their full potential beyond traditional capabilities. Recent progress in reduced and multi-dimensional materials coupled with advanced synthesis methods have significantly contributed to sensor platforms capable of direct detection of chem.-bio agents in a label-free, parallel, and multiplexed format with broad dynamic range, allowing in-situ and accurate detection of multiple agents with high sensitivity and specificity. Furthermore, the use of bio-mimetic materials is a game-changing technology as it provides ultra-sensitive reconnaissance and remote maneuverability for missions in combat theatres.

abstract="Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) enabled in a smart home requires, the design of an activity recognition system. Generally, supervised machine learning strategies or knowledge engineering strategies are employed in the process of activity modeling. Supervised machine learning approaches incur overheads in annotating the dataset, while the knowledge modeling approaches incur overhead by being dependent on the domain expert for occupant specific knowledge. The proposed approach on the other hand, employs an unsupervised machine learning strategy to readily extract knowledge from unlabelled data and subsequently represents it as ontology activity model. The novelty in the proposed design is in the usage of Contextual Pattern Clustering (CPC) for activity modeling. The competence of the weighted Jaro Winkler similarity measure introduced in CPC lies in the utilization of contextual attributes for the composition of varied event patterns of an activity. Hierarchical strategy employed in CPC offers structured knowledge on activities and sub activities within a specific location. Additionally, the event organizer and habitual event generator subsystem introduced in the proposed framework derives knowledge related to event ordering and contextual description of an activity. The attained knowledge is later represented as a probabilistic ontology activity model to enable probabilistic reasoning over domain knowledge. An experimental analysis with a smart home dataset demonstrates the proficiency of the proposed unsupervised approach in activity modeling and recognition in comparison with that of the existing modeling strategies.",

On this basis, a model is designed to recognize the structure of networks. Based on the model, we investigate the impacts of network structure on disease dynamics that is an important empirical study to the propagation dynamics. The time-varying infected number R is the important parameter that is used to quantify the disease dynamics.

abstract="The use of Ambient-Assisted Living (AAL) systems has been spreading across several countries, with the ultimate purpose of improving the quality of life of patients. These systems often reflect complex architectures including several components such as sensors, gateways, Information Systems or even actuators, as well as messaging and transmitting protocols. Failures in these systems can have severe impact on a monitored patient, and most components foresee some kind of compensation countermeasures to increase reliability. Nevertheless, these measures are often self-contained to a single component and do not address the overall AAL system reliability, disregarding precedent and successor activities and interactions that exist for each time a certain value is registered or a certain alert is triggered. In this paper, we propose a new approach to calculate the overall reliability of an AAL system. We take a Business Process Management (BPM) approach to model the activities and interactions between AAL components, using the Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN) standard. By extending the BPMN standard to include reliability information, we can derive the overall reliability of a certain AAL system. To prove this approach, we also present a reliability study considering scenarios with single and pairwise reliability variations of AAL system components. With this approach, healthcare managers can benefit from important overall reliability information of an AAL system, and better allocate the appropriate resources (including hardware or health care professionals) to improve responsiveness of care to patients.",

As a first prototype, the system was limited to library-like experimental setups and the anomaly was defined by arousal heart rate---unusually high heart beats. Using a smartwatch and a simple three-question questionnaire, we were able to collect referential arousal heart rate data from 25 healthy subjects together with their individual rating scores regarding three habit factors---smoking, drinking alcohol and eating fatty foods. According to our semi-quantitative user testings in a controlled library environment, the prototype was able to wirelessly connect and synchronize all devices, send the alarm, and perform real-time heart rate measurement as well as calculation. Based on confusion matrix evaluation, our anomaly detection gave promising results of 95Â {\%} accuracy and 90Â {\%} precision. However, major revision was required for the anomaly detection to cover unobserved factors, and there were serious usability problems regarding the smartwatch to be fixed.",

abstract="When wearable and personal health device and sensors capture data such as heart rate and body temperature for fitness tracking and health services, they simply transfer data without filtering or optimising. This can cause overloading to the sensors as well as rapid battery consumption when they interact with Internet of Things (IoT) networks, which are expected to increase and demand more health data from device wearers. To solve the problem, this paper proposes to infer sensed data to reduce the data volume, which will affect the bandwidth and battery power reduction that are essential requirements to sensor devices. This is achieved by applying beacon data points after the inferencing of data processing utilising variance rates, which compare the sensed data with adjacent data before and after. This novel approach verifies by experiments that data volume can be saved by up to 99.5Â {\%} with a 98.62Â {\%} accuracy. Whilst most existing works focus on sensor network improvements such as routing, operation and reading data algorithms, we efficiently reduce data volume to reduce bandwidth and battery power consumption while maintaining accuracy by implementing intelligence and optimisation in sensor devices.",

abstract="Wearable devices have recently become popular, and more and more people now buy and wear these devices to obtain health-related services. However, as wearable device technology quickly advances, its security cannot keep up with the speed of its development. As a result, it is highly likely for the devices to have severe vulnerabilities. Moreover, because these wearable devices are usually light-weight, they delegate a large portion of their operations as well as permissions to a software gateways on computers or smartphones, which put users at high risk if there are vulnerabilities in these gateways. In order to validate this claim, we analyzed three devices as a case study and found a total 17 vulnerabilities in them. We verified that an adversary can utilize these vulnerabilities to compromise the software gateway and take over a victim's computers and smartphones. We also suggest possible mitigation to improve the security of wearable devices.",

abstract="This paper studies the design of information systems that leverage the use of both sensors and the social web, while addressing solutions for children in socially challenging situations. Socially challenging situations are defined as situations in which one experiences negative social pressure and, therefore, requires immediate help from trusted people. The authors first provide a glimpse into the rapid development in sensors and the rise in the importance of the social web. The paper then sheds light on the theme of socially challenging situations, which is elaborated through two workshops, and defines the core areas of focus. Further, a low-fidelity prototype for the safety of children is created and evaluated in a small-scale user experiment. The state of the current technology is then reviewed in order to visualize the possible practical realization of solutions. The outcomes of these steps provide interesting insights for possible future work.",

In this paper, we propose the use of blockchain technology in combination with digital signatures to create smart digital contracts to seal the query and the respective results each time a third-party requests evidence from a reference biomedical database.

abstract="Medication prescriptions are an important class of medical intervention orders. Their complexity ranges widely, depending on the nature of the patient's condition and the prescribed substance(s). In today's IT supported clinical environments, prescriptions are often authored electronically. Patient adherence to the prescribed medication regimen is a key determinant for the outcome of the intervention. Recently, an increasing number of information technologies are entering the consumer market with a goal to assist patients with adhering to their prescriptions. The effectiveness (and safety) of these technologies is limited to simplistic cases, however, because of the lack of a precise semantics for more complex prescription orders. To close this gap, we present an approach to formalize the meaning of medication prescriptions based on a graph-transformation system. This allows for more complex and variable prescriptions to be semantically coded and their adherence to be automatically monitored. Our work has been implemented within a prototypical prescribing tool and validated with domain experts.",

In such systems, we can expect to predict each patient's probability of survival based on real-time vital data. In this paper, we focus on prehospital care and propose a method to determine treatment plans and schedules of patients. The proposed method maximizes the number of expected saved patients under limited medical resources. This optimization problem is called Treatment Planning and Scheduling, which is NP-hard. Therefore, we propose a heuristic algorithm based on depth-limited search. We have compared the proposed method with greedy methods. The results show the proposed method can derive solutions in practical time and the average number of saved patients is 10{\%} larger compared to the greedy methods.",

abstract="Advances in wireless communication technologies and the internet of things are leading to new developments in the domain of wearable, smart medical devices (SMDs) as a major disruptive trend for the medical industry. Wearable smart sensor technology with non-invasive or invasive implantable materials has a great potential for interfacing with the human body, thanks to low-power silicon-based electronics that are very efficient in data processing and transmission. Novel SMDs are designed for monitoring living being's vital signs, such as blood pressure, cardiac monitoring, respiration rate, body temperature, etc. in either medical diagnostic or health monitoring. Considering various smart devices in the medical industry, a key decision is which device to choose and apply on the patient. The decision on the evaluation of SMDs is a complicated problem that needs to be assessed from different perspectives. This study guides decision makers on the selection of SMDs of wearable vital sign sensors under different evaluation criteria. A multi criteria decision making approach is proposed to support the SMD selection process under group decision making (GDM) in an uncertain environment. A significant feature of this analysis is the complexity of the selected decision criteria for the SMD evaluation. To simulate these processes, a methodology that combines interval valued intuitionistic fuzzy (IVIF) with Vi{\v{s}}ekriterijumsko kompromisno rangiranje (VIKOR) under GDM is proposed. This methodology is then used to measure the assessment of four SMDs using five evaluation criteria. To validate the proposed approach, the selection methodology for wearable vital sign monitoring devices is applied on a case study.",

Because of reduced physical distances and the growth in competence of technology, the free-choice based subject's responsibility, which initially appeared `augmented', in reality decreases and becomes an illusion, quite as the cubism illusionism of Braque and Picasso painting. Indeed, in this frame of work, responsibility appears to shift from the augmented individual to organisations and institutions managing technology with competence, within a frame of a digital technology Corporate Social Responsibility.",

In this paper, we present a platform integrating CDL with Kevoree, a component-based software framework for Dynamically Adaptive Systems. We explain how the capabilities of Kevoree are exploited to overcome several technical issues, such as communication, information exchange and detection, and explain how the reasoning methods may be further extended.

abstract="Connected to cloud, mobile devices enable workers to manage the business processes hosted on remote process engines. However, traditional business process execution is not tailored for mobile devices. Typically the business logic remains in the cloud, making the process execution on mobile devices vulnerable to unreliable network connection. In this paper, we propose a framework that assigns, deploys business process from cloud onto mobile devices and executes them in disconnected environments. To model the process assignment and execution on mobile devices, we extend BPMN with context constraints such as location and hardware resources. The proposed framework benefits from centralized process model management and the distributed process execution on mobile devices, regardless of the constant access to cloud. We implemented a prototype of mobile process engine with an application for blood pressure examination used by nurses in rural areas.",

What functions are necessary but have no attraction? These function demands of users are not understood thoroughly. So far, there is no much study to differentiate varieties of function demands of smart home. In addition, their preference for requirements of smart home is different as different groups are different in consumption psychology and consumption behavior. For example, the consumption behavior of middle-aged group is rather conservative and youth group is active in thinking and likes to buy some new products and try new life. Therefore how to position the development of relative smart home products according to different target groups is an important subject needed to think.",

The mortality in 2014 was 123.92/lakh, which was 4.4 times higher than in 2002. Cardiovascular disease is ranked No. 1 in cause of death in China right now, in both rural and urban areas. This paper presents a medical information sharing platform based on mobile Internet, cloud computing and big data mining. It is designed to support the PB-level data management and analysis, and millions of concurrent instant messaging. The platform has the following functions: intelligent transportation decision support based on FMC-D time, built-in medical communication unit, built-in medical information sharing unit and quality control system of PCI hospital interventional images. The platform is divided into two parts - medical unit terminals (including EMS terminal, non-PCI hospital terminal and PCI hospital terminal) and cloud computing server, in which data is exchanged via 3G/4G wireless networks. The system has the following characteristics: (1) Timeline, which is a collection of key nodes that describe the AMI patient care process, (2) Smart recommendation technology, for example recommending hospitals based on the distance, medical care ability, idle resource. (3) Capacity to support, such as large number of concurrent collaborative treatment process among multiple PCI hospitals, multi-non-PCI medical institutions, and multi-EMS institutions, as well as the PB level data which are generated in the process.",

Sensors, actuators and software create a closed feedback loop between the physical and the cyber world. Current process execution systems mostly focus on web-based workflow applications and are not directly compatible with CPS environments. Especially the processing of low-level sensor events as well as the integration of heterogeneous components--including the users--as process resources are limited in current workflow systems. In this work, we propose PROtEUS: an integrated system for process execution in cyber-physical systems. PROtEUS is able to bridge the gap between hardware-related processes and human-centered workflows. It enables the integration of sensor data from various sources into model-based processes, the flexible access to heterogeneous resources, as well as user interactions in processes.

abstract="Tracking indoor locations of residents is a prerequisite of accurate monitoring and advanced understanding of human activities in smart homes. Without using any indoor video surveillance devices in terms of preserving privacy and security, majority of existing approaches often utilise wearable BLE/RFID sensor tags to track locations of residents through analysing variations of received signal strength and angle of sensor tags. In a multi-residential environment, these tags can also be used as unique identifiers to help distinguish individuals. However, the extra burdens of remembering and wearing sensor tags all day along restrict them to be widely accepted by senior communities, let alone by people with neurodegenerative diseases. In this study, we propose a novel indoor tracking technique for smart homes with multiple residents, through relying only on non-wearable, environmentally deployed sensors such as passive infrared motion sensors. We design a multi-tracker system that uses multiple, independent probabilistic models, such as Naive Bayes and hidden Markov model, to track different residents' movements separately. We evaluate our tracking technique on real sensor data acquired from a dual-occupancy smart home in our clinical trials. The experiment results, through comparing with location details acquired by wearable tags, demonstrate that our proposed technique is a simple yet feasible solution to tracking multi-residents' indoor movements.",

Agriculture relates closely to people's livelihood but usually suffers as a weak sector in economics. Attentions to agriculture are regained as food safety and shortage become world-wide concerns. This paper addresses an analogy between industrial manufacturing and agriculture production to demonstrate that industrial management can adapt to agriculture. In particular, enterprise resource planning system (ERP), which is the core management information system used by most manufacturing enterprises, can be implemented in farming. Our short-term goal is to transform traditional farms to ``managed factories'' to produce safe products effectively. The ultimate goals are to provide the public with safe products, to increase farmers' income and to elevate farmer's economic status to a new middle class. In particular, new job opportunities are expected to be created in farms management.",

abstract="Air pollution is one of the pressing issues faced not only by human race but also by Earth's vegetation. There are numerous findings regarding the effects of air pollution, for instance air pollutants playing a notorious role in inducing asthma and in formation of acid rain. Apart from regular activities done by government like creating acts, setting standards and regular inspection in industries to provide people with pollution free environment, various mobile apps like Air Quality India, SAFAR Air have been developed and disseminated to create environmental awareness. But even then, air pollution persists due to gases from vehicles on roads, Choloro Fluro Carbon from home appliances, Carbon Monoxide from incomplete combustion of fuels or gas, particulate matters from cigarette smoking, cooking etc. Individuals are affected by these air pollutants which are predominant in the air they breathe in. It is necessary to educate people on how to ameliorate the effects of air pollutants and control air pollution. In this paper, we have presented a framework that utilizes data from social networks and supervised machine learning algorithm, which will facilitate in taking an initial step towards a smart environment in smart cities. A part of our proposed application was tested with a group of people. These experiments showed better accuracy in classifying people according to the place where they spend most of their time in a day, and also received good responses from the people.",

abstract="We present and evaluate a microcontroller-optimized limited-memory implementation of a Warping Longest Common Subsequence algorithm (WarpingLCSS). It permits to spot patterns within noisy sensor data in real-time in resource constrained sensor nodes. It allows variability in the sensed system dynamics through warping; it uses only integer operations; it can be applied to various sensor modalities; and it is suitable for embedded training to recognize new patterns. We illustrate the method on 3 applications from wearable sensing and activity recognition using 3 sensor modalities: spotting the QRS complex in ECG, recognizing gestures in everyday life, and analyzing beach volleyball. We implemented the system on a low-power 8-bit AVR wireless node and a 32-bit ARM Cortex M4 microcontroller. Up to 67 or 140 10-second gestures can be recognized simultaneously in real-time from a 10Hz motion sensor on the AVR and M4 using 8mW and 10mW respectively. A single gesture spotter uses as few as 135$\mu$W on the AVR. The method allows low data rate distributed in-network recognition and we show a 100 fold data rate reduction in a complex activity recognition scenario. The versatility and low complexity of the method makes it well suited as a generic pattern recognition method and could be implemented as part of sensor front-ends.",

abstract="As Taiwan enters an aging society, osteoarthritisOsteoarthritis (OA) has become a common chronic disease among the elderly population. Knee is the most predilection site of OA. In the later stages of OA, knee replacementKnee replacement surgery is considered the best treatment of OA. A complete course of treatment, however, does not end once the operation is over; instead, it includes the follow-up rehabilitation exercise, tracks and observation. Rehabilitation exercise requires patient cooperation to continue with the rehabilitation at home. Due to various factors, however, many patients are unable to carry out the rehabilitation adequately to ensure satisfactory results. Hence, it is important to have a home-based rehabilitation system that could enable the communication between the patients and their doctors, and record the information about their rehabilitation. The system developed in this study uses a 3-Axis G SensorG sensor to measure the knee angles during the rehabilitation, and uses Bluetooth to transmit the rehabilitation data to the computer. The data are then stored in a cloud database and are presented visually in the back-end. The physiatrists in the hospital have real-time access to and monitor every patient in their course of rehabilitation, thus giving them prompt feedbacks. The proposed remote rehabilitation platform makes it possible for patients and doctors to improve the quality of home rehabilitation after knee replacement surgery.",

abstract="In an effort to increase handpump reliability, the Messiah College Collaboratory and the Department of Computer and Information Science are developing the Intelligent Water Project (IWP) system. IWP measures and reports the functionality of handpumps and volume of water extracted on two-hour intervals daily. Additionally, IWP will measure groundwater levels which can be used to evaluate well yields. Data from handpumps is automatically collected and transmitted to a remote database. Once in the database, the data is analyzed and distributed to stakeholders via web and mobile applications and customizable alerts. Besides monitoring water extraction, handpump performance, and borehole health, the IWP system processes data to alert stakeholders of failure or degrading conditions (imminent failure). Coupled with appropriate field management processes, this information can lead to improved handpump availability and lowered cost of ownership. The key goal is to dramatically increase the reliability of handpumps. A secondary goal is the collection of handpump data from all IWP enabled pump sources providing a rich resource of data to enabling WASH practitioners, managers, hydrologist and donors to make more informed decisions. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the key IWP software design considerations and to discuss the key software design decisions made and the rationale for the same.",

abstract="In recent years, low-end embedded devices have been used increasingly in various scenarios, ranging from consumer electronics to industrial equipment. However, this evolution made embedded devices profitable targets for software piracy and software manipulation. Aggravating this situation, low-end embedded devices typically lack secure hardware to effectively protect against such attacks. In this work, we present a novel software protection scheme, which is particularly suited for already deployed low-end embedded devices without secure hardware. Our approach combines techniques based on self-checksumming code with Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) to establish a hardware-assisted software protection. In this way, we can tie the execution of a software instance to a specific device and protect its program code against manipulations. We show that our software protection scheme offers a high level of security against static adversaries and demonstrate that dynamic adversaries require considerable resources to perform a successful attack. To explore the feasibility of our solution, we implemented the protection scheme on an ARM-based low-end commodity microcontroller. A further performance evaluation shows that the implemented solution exhibits a fair overhead of ten percent.",

abstract="[Context/Background]: With the increasing use of cyber-physical systems in complex socio-technical setups, mechanisms that hold specific entities accountable for safety and security incidents are needed. Although there exist models that try to capture and formalize accountability concepts, many of these lack practical implementations. We hence know little about how accountability mechanisms work in practice and how specific entities could be held responsible for incidents. [Goal]: As a step towards the practical implementation of providing accountability, this systematic mapping study investigates existing implementations of accountability concepts with the goal to (1) identify a common definition of accountability and (2) identify the general trend of practical research. [Method]: To survey the literature for existing implementations, we conducted a systematic mapping study. [Results]: We thus contribute by providing a systematic overview of current accountability realizations and requirements for future accountability approaches. [Conclusions]: We find that existing practical accountability research lacks a common definition of accountability in the first place. The research field seems rather scattered with no generally accepted architecture and/or set of requirements. While most accountability implementations focus on privacy and security, no safety-related approaches seem to exist. Furthermore, we did not find excessive references to relevant and related concepts such as reasoning, log analysis and causality.",

We group the papers into six topical groups, and then attempt to map these groups to the framework to find research gaps for future research. We find that the groups of papers cover all areas of the framework well for a variety of work and leisure domains. The area in strongest need for more research papers is the development of the holistic framework itself. Furthermore, much focus has been on studying design sketching or implemented systems-in-use, while little attention has been paid to mature design (prototypes) or early implementation (content templates). In conclusion, we recommend an update to the framework so that it can be also useful for research in prototyping and early organizational implementation.",

abstract="Textile user interfaces for smart homes offer novel intuitive input gestures and may lower acceptance barrier for technophobic or elderly people. To understand the users' requirements of smart textile input devices, an Adaptive Conjoint Analysis with the attributes wearability, functionality, haptic, location, and components was carried out with 100 participants. The attributes were rated with different importances. Users request non-wearable textile input devices with no noticeable electronics for the living room. Gender, but no age effects were identified, as women prefer health applications, whereas men prefer media control. In summary, the device needs to be individually tailored to the user's requirements to achieve high acceptance.",

abstract="The analysis of human motion has become a major application area in computer vision. The vast majority of applications require using video cameras as main sensor for acquisition, analysis and detection of human motion. Some applications are very sensitive to the acquisition of images of people that may feel violated his right to privacy. Especially in ambient intelligence applications, non intrusive nature, whose scope is the user's home. The scope of this work was constrained to the analysis of human motion obtained from signals acquired for PIR sensors. We propose a method to classify PIR signals regarding two parameters: speed and distance from sensor to the subject. Our method allows to get compact devices that perform local computation and are able to transmit middle abstraction level context information in an efficient way. Signals from a PIR sensor array generated by several subjects have been registered to get patterns. Subjects moved at a certain speed at a given distance from sensors, so patterns are indexed by these two parameters. The patterns are then used to classify other tests signals regarding the mentioned parameters. The hit rate, for the method which combines information from all the sensors in the array, results in 79{\%} for distance classification, 96{\%} for speed classification and 77{\%} for classification regarding both parameters simultaneously. We consider that this is a satisfying result for a non intrusive method.",

abstract="The nested Petri nets are a nets-within-nets formalism convenient for modelling systems that consist of distributed mobile agents with individual behaviour. The formalism is supported by developed verification methods based on structural analysis and model checking techniques. Time constraints are crucial for many safety critical and everyday IoT systems. Recently, the non Turing-complete time semantics for Time Petri nets based on restricted urgency was suggested; and, it was shown that some behavioural analysis problems are decidable under the semantics. In the paper, the semantics is extended to the nested Petri nets formalism and it was demonstrated that some behavioural analysis problems are still decidable. The semantics is illustrated by an example of a health monitoring system.",

In this paper we discuss the properties of digital technologies that can be potentially helpful for the elderly and we suggest that social innovation provides a robust theoretical framework to conceive radical-digital loneliness interventions. We also draw parallels between loneliness interventions based on social innovation and the emerging `sharing economy' in the digital world and discuss the role of third paradigm of HCI research in this area.",

abstract="Implantable Medical Devices (IMDs) are used to monitor and treat physiological conditions within the body. They communicate telemetry data to external reader/programmer device and receive control commands using wireless medium. Wireless communication for IMDs increases cost effectiveness, flexibility, ease of use and also enables remote configuration and monitoring. However, it makes the IMDs vulnerable to passive and active attacks. While passive attacks on IMDs can be addressed using encryption techniques, active attacks like replay, massage injection and MITM need more advanced techniques to be detected and prevented. In case of other wireless devices one can deal with these security issues by installing one or more security mechanisms, but the same cannot be applied to IMDs. This is due to their positioning inside human body which makes replacement and power charging extremely difficult, their miniaturization which makes them storage, processing and power scarce, their unusual access requirements during device or patient emergency and their incapability of renewing shared secrets. It is advisable to use the resources of IMDs for life critical medical care and minimalist communication. This leads to the implied option of using an external proxy device which can offload security related processing from IMDs. Therefore, to address the problem of active attacks, we propose use of RF-signal based localization technique which leverages multi-antenna Proxy Device to profile the directions at which reader/programmer signal arrives and use of triangulation techniques to construct a signature that uniquely distinguishes an authorized reader/programmer from unauthorized one.",

abstract="Driven by new application domains, the database management systems (DBMSs) landscape has significantly evolved from single node DBMS to distributed database management systems (DDBMSs). In parallel, cloud computing became the preferred solution to run distributed applications. Hence, modern DDBMSs are designed to run in the cloud. Yet, in distributed systems the probability of failures is the higher the more entities are involved and by using cloud resources the probability of failures increases even more. Therefore, DDBMSs apply data replication across multiple nodes to provide high availability. Yet, high availability limits consistency or partition tolerance as stated by the CAP theorem. As the decision for two of the three attributes in not binary, the heterogeneous landscape of DDBMSs gets even more complex when it comes to their high availability mechanisms. Hence, the selection of a high available DDBMS to run in the cloud becomes a very challenging task, as supportive evaluation frameworks are not yet available. In order to ease the selection and increase the trust in running DDBMSs in the cloud, we present the Gibbon framework, a novel availability evaluation framework for DDBMSs. Gibbon defines quantifiable availability metrics, a customisable evaluation methodology and a novel evaluation framework architecture. Gibbon is discussed by an availability evaluation of MongoDB, analysing the take over and recovery time.",

Based on the effects of environmental factors on pig growth, this paper established an early-warning model of the piggery environment. Using the model and the environmental factors, which were obtained in real time from a piggery, it was possible to obtain timely warning information, conducive to both creating an appropriate breeding environment for pigs and reducing the incidence of disease. In this article, we established the environmental early-warning indicators relating to pig breeding and then demonstrated the method based on single-factor and fuzzy comprehensive multi-factor models of the piggery environment. Finally, the two models were analyzed based on the experimental results, which showed that the fuzzy comprehensive early-warning model performed better than the single-factor model, and that it could be applied in an intensive farming environment to provide timely warning of environmental deterioration, to maintain the safety of the pig-breeding environment.",

Smart home is one of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications that is following this trend. However, sensors and smart devices are generating data that may reveal personal information about home inhabitants. Therefore, outsourcing sensed data from smart home to the cloud is raising serious privacy concerns. In particular, when untrusted third party cloud services are accessing personal identifiable information (PII) beyond their collection purpose. One privacy preserving approach consists of encrypting the data, before it is outsourced to the cloud, according to user settings. In this paper, we target preserving data privacy of smart home inhabitants. For this purpose, we proposed an architecture integrating attribute based encryption (ABE) schemes to the Smart Home Middleware `Openhab'. To evaluate our framework, we conducted experiments to measure the performances and the overheads introduced by the proposed privacy preserving solution.",

abstract="In diverse sectors companies collaborate to offer integrated user-centric services to obtain competitive advantage. However, regarding elderly care, services are typically isolated, and mostly provided by a single provider. Moreover, there is a need to personalize services in respect of the individuality of each senior and making these services evolve according to the lifestyle and necessities of the person. In this context, the concept of Elderly Care Ecosystem (ECE) emerges as a computer-based collaborative environment that promotes the integration of distinct services and providers. ECEs are complex systems that demand a clear description of their requirements, especially of those related to personalization of services. In this paper, we describe a set of core requirements and challenges for designing personalized services in an elderly care ecosystem. In particular, our contributions are: the identification of the main stakeholders of an ECE, the requirements to build a persona profile in ECE, and a reference requirements model based on i* for service personalization in ECE.",

abstract="Our societies are in the midst of a paradigm shift that transforms hierarchal markets into an open and networked economy based on digital technology and information. In that context, open data is widely presumed to have a positive effect on social, environmental and economic value; however the evidence to that effect has remained scarce. Subsequently, we address the question how the use of open data can stimulate the generation of sustainable value. We argue that open data sharing and reuse can empower new ways of generating value in the sharing society. Moreover, we propose a model that describes how different mechanisms that take part within an open system generate sustainable value. These mechanisms are enabled by a number of contextual factors that provide individuals with the motivation, opportunity and ability to generate sustainable value.",

abstract="We live in an emerging hyper-connected era in which people are in contact and interacting with an increasing number of other people and devices. Increasingly, modern IT systems form networks of humans and machines that interact with one another. As machines take a more active role in such networks, they exert an increasing level of influence on other participants. We review the existing literature on agency and propose a definition of agency that is practical for describing the capabilities and impact human and machine actors may have in a human-machine network. On this basis, we discuss and demonstrate the impact and trust implications for machine actors in human-machine networks for emergency decision support, healthcare and future smart homes. We maintain that machine agency not only facilitates human to machine trust, but also interpersonal trust; and that trust must develop to be able to seize the full potential of future technology.",

abstract="Wearable devices, e.g. smart-watches, are gaining popularity in many fields and in wellness monitoring too. In this paper we propose an IoT application to alert the medical doctor assigned to a critical unit by using a smart-watch. The wearable device improves the efficacy of monitoring patients at risk in hospital units allowing the medical doctor to access information at any time and from any place. A network was built to wirelessly connect bio-sensing platforms, which measure metabolites concentration in patients' fluids (e.g. blood), with a dedicated application running on the smart-watch. In case of anomalous measured values, incoming alert notifications are received to ask urgent medical intervention. The main advantage of this new approach is that the doctors, or in general the caregivers, can freely move in the hospital other structures and perform other tasks meanwhile simultaneously and constantly monitoring all the patients thanks to the technology on their wrist.",

abstract="It is challenging to know emotion status of people at run time as emotion can be influenced by many factors. Speech contents heart rates are used in our former work on hybrid emotion recognition approach. However, fixed emotional keywords is not enough as there may be unknown and new keywords arise. Therefore we add semantic similarity to emotional keywords recognition. After obtaining the content of the user, even if the emotional keywords are not in the knowledge base, we calculate the similarity between the keywords in the talk of the user and the words in the knowledge base. A hybrid similarity calculation algorithm is proposed to alleviate the problems that some words do not exist in HowNet knowledge base where we combine the similarity calculation method for Tongyici Cilin. If the similarity is greater than a threshold, then a corresponding emotion status will be recognized together with the heart rate of the user. The advantage of using semantic similarity is that it is much more flexible than the one with only fixed emotional keywords in the knowledge base, together with a higher recognition accuracy than before.",

abstract="Activity- and context-aware systems, as they are known, established, and well evaluated in small-scale laboratory settings for years and decades, suffer from the fact, that they are limited concerning the underlying data delivering entities. The sensor systems are usually attached on the body, on objects, or in the environment, directly surrounding persons or groups whose activities or contextual information has to be detected. For sensors that are exploited in this kind of systems, it is essential that their modalities, positions and technical details are initially defined to ensure a stable and accurate system execution. In contrast to that, opportunistic sensing allows for selecting and utilizing sensors, as they happen to be accessible according to their spontaneous availability, without presumably defining the input modalities, on a goal-oriented principle. One major benefit thereby is the capability of utilizing sensors of different kinds and modalities, even immaterial sources of information like webservices, by abstracting low-level access details. This emerges the need to roll out the data federating entity as decentralized collecting point. Cloud-based technologies enable space- and time-free utilization of a vast amount of heterogeneous sensor devices reaching from simple physical devices (e.g., GPS, accelerometers, as they are conventionally included on today's smart phones) to social media sensors, like Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. This paper presents an opportunistic, cloud-based approach for large-scale activity- and context-recognition.",

Consequently, context-awareness makes a significant difference to mobile HCI. However, the challenges brought by context-awareness to users of mobile devices are rarely examined in depth. In this paper, previous conceptions of context and their contribution to context-awareness in mobile HCI is scrutinized and a preliminary context-computer interaction (CCI) model is advanced to illustrate the interaction characterized by mobile context-awareness. Furthermore, the paper examines the limitations of information processing models and review alternative models of context. We also address user experience challenges related to the enablement of mobile context-awareness and highlight avenues for future research issues. Specifically, we found that context-awareness has been employed broadly in developing applications and services on mobile platform, has had a huge impact on mobile user experience, and has altered the interaction between humans and computers by giving the latter a more active role to play. The significance of context-awareness in the usage of mobile systems calls for systematic and in-depth appreciation of its impact on mobile HCI.",

abstract="Sleep quality and in general, behavior in bed can be detected using a sleep state analysis. These results can help a subject to regulate sleep and recognize different sleeping disorders. In this work, a sensor grid for pressure and movement detection supporting sleep phase analysis is proposed. In comparison to the leading standard measuring system, which is Polysomnography (PSG), the system proposed in this project is a non-invasive sleep monitoring device. For continuous analysis or home use, the PSG or wearable Actigraphy devices tends to be uncomfortable. Besides this fact, they are also very expensive. The system represented in this work classifies respiration and body movement with only one type of sensor and also in a non-invasive way. The sensor used is a pressure sensor. This sensor is low cost and can be used for commercial proposes. The system was tested by carrying out an experiment that recorded the sleep process of a subject. These recordings showed the potential for classification of breathing rate and body movements. Although previous researches show the use of pressure sensors in recognizing posture and breathing, they have been mostly used by positioning the sensors between the mattress and bedsheet. This project however, shows an innovative way to position the sensors under the mattress.",

Detecting consumption anomalies is, essentially, a real-time big data analytics problem, which does data mining on a large amount of parallel data streams from smart meters. In this paper, we propose a supervised learning and statistical-based anomaly detection method, and implement a Lambda system using the in-memory distributed computing framework, Spark and its extension Spark Streaming. The system supports not only iterative refreshing the detection models from scalable data sets, but also real-time anomaly detection on scalable live data streams.

The approach permits both bottom up and top down methods of reasoning about data. The tradeoffs between granularity of ground truth acquisition and its impact on the detection rate are presented. It is suggested that the acquisition of ground truth should become a seamless operation incorporated transparently into the workflow of operations in these facilities. It is expected that with automation of collection, the increasing corpus of ground truth will lead to steady improvements in the detection rate and therefore the quality of automated monitoring and care provisioning. The methodology and models are substantiated with real data from two assisted living facilities, one in Singapore and the other in France.

abstract="Last decade saw the development of Wireless Sensor Networks with multitude of applications built around the sensors. Though most of the issues at protocol and device level remain solved for Wireless Sensor Networks, there is a growing trend in integration of sensors and sensor based systems with Cyber Physical Systems, Machine-to-Machine and Device-to-Device communication both in infrastructure and ad-hoc modes. The emergence of Cloud Computing, highly intelligent 'Smart' devices and efforts towards 5th Generation telecom systems is expected to lead the revolution of a networked world with increased demand for situational awareness leading proliferation of sensors at the edge of physical world. Mounting intelligence built in 'smart' devices, scarcity of frequency spectrum, disruptive technologies and limitations on further reduction in base station size may render base station centric-architecture of today's wireless networks old-fashioned. Due to low data rate bursty nature of sensor data, massive-MIMO antennas, device-centric architectures, smarter devices and native support for Machine-to-Machine and Device-to-Device communication, sensor data originating from these systems and disruptive technologies is expected to grow manifold through passing years. Communication and network engineers face an emerging challenge of designing communication and network protocols that can efficiently get integrated with the emerging wireless cellular and computing paradigms. In this paper, we list down these communication and networking challenges and provide our vision for Wireless Sensor Networks related platforms and enabling technologies of next decade.",

This paper demonstrates how the convergence of Agent Based Modelling, Smart Contracts, Blockchain, and Virtual Reality (VR) technologies make possible the development of participatory decision support frameworks. The concept is demonstrated in a public health context by implementing an Agent Based Model of disease spread within a simulated population (SIR model) as a so-called Smart Contract deployed on a public Blockchain network. We demonstrate that in order to ``close the loop'' the simulation outcomes can be visualized using commodity VR hardware, and future extensions towards fully interactive simulations are proposed.",

Users frequently report difficulties in reading the material, finding the required information and understanding the technical jargon, and/or have lost the sheet. The purpose of this study was to assess the participants' needs and major difficulties in using a medicine paper fact sheet, as well as their acceptance of a digital solution. Two focus groups sessions were conducted on a sample of 15 participants, divided into three groups (young adults, middle-aged adults, young-older adults). Differences among groups were found for difficulties with the paper version and the expectations regarding the digital version. Findings suggest that digital fact sheet may serve as a positive solution, but is mostly seen by the participants as a complement of the paper version.",

abstract="Many engineered systems are biologically inspired. In this paper, we examine the structure of the human nervous system with an eye toward understanding how its internal architecture may inform the design of large-scale engineered systems. Specifically, we examine four types of ``generic'' architectures -- tree-structured hierarchies, layered hierarchies, diffuse networks, and teams. We observe all four types of these hierarchies in the human nervous system. Consistent with prior theory, tree-structured hierarchies are relatively inflexible, but simple and easy to control. Layered hierarchies are moderately flexible, more complex, yet still largely controllable. Diffuse networks are easy to describe and therefore relatively simple yet flexible; however, they can lead to unexpected emergent behaviors undermining controllability. Finally, team structures are extremely flexible, but can lead to instabilities. Implications for system design are discussed.",

The main reasons leading to this situation is lack of food security mechanism, and the information is not timely updated on all aspects of food from production to consumption, which could not be found when the food safety problems occur. For this case, this paper is based on RFID technology, combined with existing food production, warehousing and logistics, and proposes a comprehensive food safety traceability system. The system is designed and implemented, which can improve the productivity of food enterprises in the production section, reduce the error rate of storage and logistic links, and enhance food security, which also improves information sharing and enhances the competitiveness of food enterprises.",

abstract="There is increasing realisation that edge devices, which are closer to a user, can play an important part in supporting latency and privacy sensitive applications. Such devices have also continued to increase in capability over recent years, ranging in complexity from embedded resources (e.g. Raspberry Pi, Arduino boards) placed alongside data capture devices to more complex ``micro data centres''. Using such resources, a user is able to carry out task execution and data storage in proximity to their location, often making use of computing resources that can have varying ownership and access rights. Increasing performance requirements for stream processing applications (for instance), which incur delays between the client and the cloud have led to newer models of computation, which requires an application workflow to be split across data centre and edge resource capabilities. With recent emergence of edge/fog computing it has become possible to migrate services to micro-data centres and to address the performance limitations of traditional (centralised data centre) cloud based applications. Such migration can be represented as a cost function that involves incentives for micro-data centres to host services with associated quality of services and experience. Business models need to be developed for creating an open edge cloud environment where micro-data centres have the right incentives to support service hosting, and for large scale data centre operators to outsource service execution to such micro data centres. We describe potential revenue models for micro-data centers to support service migration and serve incoming requests for edge based applications. We present several cost models which involve combined use of edge devices and centralised data centres.",

The recent introduction of IoT (Internet of things) connected hearing instruments offer new opportunities for hearables to collect behavioral data that capture device usage and user intents and thereby provide insights to adjust the settings of the device. In our study 6 participants shared their volume and interaction data capturing when they remotely changed their device settings over eight weeks. The data confirms that the participants preferred to actively change programs rather than use a single default setting provided by an audiologist. Furthermore, their unique usage patterns indicate a need for designing hearing instruments, which as hearables adapt their settings dynamically to individual preferences during the day.",

At the same time, existing frameworks useful for understanding these dynamic spatio-temporal data, such as time geography, are unable to scale to the high volume, velocity, and variety of these emerging data sources. In this paper, we introduce a computational framework that turns time geography into a scalable analysis tool that can handle large and rapidly changing datasets. The Hierarchical Prism Tree (HPT) is a dynamic data structure for fast queries on spatio-temporal objects based on time geographic principles and theories, which takes advantage of recent advances in moving object databases and computer graphics. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed HPT using two common time geography tasks (finding similar trajectories and mapping potential space-time interactions), taking advantage of open data on space-time vehicle emissions from the EnviroCar platform.",

In this light, compliance checking emerged as an effective way to understand whether an observed course of interaction agrees with what is expected by a model of the system. In this paper, we single out a non exhaustive list of desiderata and challenges for compliance checking applied at runtime. We then argue that methods, tools and techniques of Computational Logic, and Abductive Reasoning in particular, can be fruitfully exploited to tackle all such challenges in a formally grounded, computationally effective way.",

abstract="Assets are complex mixes of complex systems, built from components which, over time, may fail. The ability to quickly and efficiently determine the cause of failures and propose optimum maintenance decisions, while minimizing the need for human intervention is necessary. Thus, for complex assets, much information needs to be captured and mined to assess the overall condition of the whole system. Therefore the integration of asset information is required to get an accurate health assessment of the whole system, and determine the probability of a shutdown or slowdown. Moreover, the data collected are not only huge but often dispersed across independent systems that are difficult to access, fuse and mine due to disparate nature and granularity. If the data from these independent systems are combined into a common correlated data source, this new set of information could add value to the individual data sources by the means of data mining. This paper proposes a knowledge discovery process based on CRISP-DM for failure diagnosis using big data sets. The process is exemplified by applying it on railway infrastructure assets. The proposed framework implies a progress beyond the state of the art in the development of Big Data technologies in the fields of Knowledge Discovery algorithms from heterogeneous data sources, scalable data structures, real-time communications and visualizations techniques.",

Consideration is given to a way of quantifying the perception of risk a user may have. An ongoing project is described in which the three aspects are being combined in an attempt to better educate users to the risks and consequences of poor security behaviour.

abstract="Many Smart Cities applications will collect data from and otherwise interact with the mobile devices of individual users. In the past, it has been difficult to assure users that smart applications will protect their private data and use the data only for the application's intended purpose. The current paper describes a plan for developing Privacy-Enhanced Android, an extension of the current Android OS with new privacy features based on homomorphic and functional encryption and Secure Multiparty Computation. Our goal is to make these advances in privacy-preserving technologies available to the mobile developer community, so that they can be broadly applied and enable the impactful social utility envisioned by Smart Cities.",

abstract="Education in the field of computer programming is a challenging task, in particular when some complex issues are introduced for non-computer science students. A number of simplified programming languages, environments and simulation software have been developed in recent years to support both teaching as well as self-learning of different programming techniques. However, there are no solutions for teaching in the domain of concurrent programming in the Java language. In this paper we present our original concept of studies using NXT robots to teach Java-based concurrency. An NXT robot equipped with Java virtual machine seems to be a good solution to improve teaching concurrent programming. Actions performed in real-time by robots allow students to observe the performance of their applications and quickly identify mistakes in their code.",

We test this approach using toy data to illustrate the effects of some well known anonymization techniques on the proposed measure.",

abstract="With the advent of information digitization, virtual social networking, and other means of information sharing protocols, today billions of data are available on the World Wide Web from heterogeneous sources. All these data further contribute to the emergence of Big Data gamut. When these data are processed further, we get a glimpse of information which gives some level of understanding on the subject or the matter (person, place, enterprise, etc.). Knowledge is cohesively logically processed related information with the intellect to give us multidimensional information spectrum for decision-making in real time. In today's global environment, data plays crucial role to understand the social, cultural, behavioral, and demographic attributes of a subject. Knowledge-as-a-Service (KAAS) is a pioneering cloud framework inheriting the ``Internet of Things'' principles that extract data from various sources in a seamless manner and can further decouple--couple logically processed information based on the ``matching chromosome'' algorithm. Unified Resource Descriptor (URD) is an innovative information modeling technique that operates over KAAS framework to further publish knowledge on the subject on need basis. Based on this concept, every resource or subject is assigned a unique identifier that can perform multilayered search in the KAAS Database to extract relevant knowledge frames. Considering India's context, second most populated country in the world, URD can play an indispensable role to tighten information dynamics holistically and accumulate a broader spectrum of knowledge of the resource to address adverse situations (natural calamity, medication, insurance, etc.), business process solution (Banking, BPOs, KPOs, etc.), and research practices.",

One of the fast ways is supplying designers with Universal Design or Accessibility checklists and asking them to test the design against the proposed criteria. This method is especially beneficial for students who learn how to design but still are not aware of universal design ideas. Such criteria can be diverse and depend on the context of design and type of a design artefact. In particular, currently there is no a well-established evaluation framework for accessibility of wearables. In this paper, we review several accessibility evaluation tools from other fields, from which criteria for evaluation of the accessibility in wearables during the design process can be borrowed.",

abstract="The extant international literature on smart cities, which are conceptualized and designed to enhance the quality of well-being, fails to provide a homogeneously unifying definition of smart city. This lack of comprehensive knowledge manifests into a critical policy challenge to policy managers responsible for creating and managing complex contours of evolution of smart cities. Smart cities, however, are increasingly becoming a subject to public debate worldwide, which appears to be a strong value-enhancing approach to managing future cities. This paper critically reviews the existing definitional conceptualization of smart cities and their changing frames in global setting across a range of criteria borrowed from literature. Further, the research maps a potential Indian smart city (case of GIFT City) on comparable framework of global smart cities with an objective of developing insights into planned efficiency of smart cities in India. The study also examines different strategies of smart city development with a spatial approach and understanding the way in which these strategies can fit into India's urban scenario. The second part of the paper delves into financing of smart cities in India. Having taken into account India's budgetary plans to develop 100 smart cities, we assess the scale and effectiveness of the plans. Given the potential economic profiles of such cities and associated financial outlays, we also explore likely sources of financing for smart cities with a strong focus on risk-return trade-offs.",

Implementation was achieved with RabbitMQ. Also, we have proposed a web application that will generate statistics based on a large volume of data. When we add a new filter (that will generate new statistics), considered as a new task, it must be taken up by a scheduler. The interface is able to configure how many such tasks can run in parallel.

To reduce the response time, we use the concept of materialized view of database, and materialized view to be as a service. And we propose materialized view to be as as service (MVaaS). In our proposition, a developer of an application can efficiently and dynamically use large-scale data from smart city by describing simple data specification without considering distributed processes and materialized views. In this paper, we design an architecture of MVaaS using MapReduce on Hadoop and HBase KVS. And we demonstrate the effectiveness of MVaaS through three case studies.

The value of Fleiss' Kappa was 0.782, over the excellent criterion of 0.75, which means the inter-rater reliability of persuasive design guideline was reliable. We collected 697 car apps from Apple iTunes Store and Google Play and examined which design principles were implemented by these car apps. The result shows that nine persuasive design principles are found, such as reduction, trustworthiness, real-world feel, self-monitoring, personalization, reminder, suggestion, expertise, and verifiability. The results from this study would suggest some implications for car app developers and automakers to develop better car apps in the future.",

abstract="Selective Laser Melting (SLM) offers various new possibilities for the production of metallic components with respect to their design and complexity. The manufacturing process in layers enables accessibility and the possibility for manipulation and modification to each section of the part's geometry. Hence the integration of sensors into the component during its manufacturing process is feasible. This approach is of enormous interest for various industrial sectors since sensor integration is a key enabler of industry 4.0. A sensor that has been embedded into a part during SLM production process facilitates not only a monitoring of this metallic part during its use phase in general but a monitoring of a spatially well-defined location within this part. The work presented in this paper specifically targets the integration of a temperature sensor into an SLM part. The sensor is embedded in a section of the part which is not accessible after the production process any more. Different concepts and strategies of sensor positioning and integration are investigated, focussing on an evaluation of the operating ability of these sensors after their embedding with the SLM process. Thus different methods to attach the sensor to the metallic part are presented. Furthermore the paper reports on the analysis of the influence of geometrical design features on the response behaviour and accuracy of the temperature measurement compared to conventionally conducted reference measurements.",

abstract="With the advancement in technology, data produced from different sources such as Internet, health care, financial companies, social media, etc. are increases continuously at a rapid rate. Potential growth of this data in terms of volume, variety and velocity coined a new emerging area of research, Big Data (BD). Continuous storage, processing, monitoring (if required), real time analysis are few current challenges of BD. However, these challenges becomes more critical when data can be uncertain, inconsistent and redundant. Hence, to reduce the overall processing time dimensionality reduction (DR) is one of the efficient techniques. Therefore, keeping in view of the above, in this paper, we have used principle component analysis (PCA) and singular value decomposition (SVD) techniques to perform DR over BD. We have compared the performance of both techniques in terms of accuracy and mean square error (MSR). Comparative results shows that for numerical reasons SVD is preferred PCA. Whereas, using PCA to train the data in dimension reduction for an image gives good classification output.",

For two types of wearable devices, HMD and smartwatch, the experts evaluated the correlation between the design spaces and the evaluating factors. Users also assessed the association between the two areas through questionnaires. Results showed that relation in between design space and evaluation factors alter by varying products.

Authentication is considered as an effective approach to protect the security and privacy of RFID systems. Based on Hash function and the randomization of the tag's identifier, a lightweight authentication protocol is proposed. The protocol uses Hash function to ensure the anonymity and confidentiality of the RFID system. It uses a randomization function to randomize the tag's identifier to enhance the difficulty to reveal the secrecy of the RFID system. Time stamp and pseudorandom number generator are combined to prevent replay attack. It also completes the strong authentication of the backend server to the tag by twice authentication. The analysis shows that this protocol provides forward security and it can prevent eavesdropping, tracing, replay and de-synchronize attack. The protocol only uses Hash function and pseudorandom number generator. It is very suitable to the low-cost RFID system.",

The model can be used to investigate how different transport infrastructure investments and policy instruments will affect the travel choices of passengers. We identified four main categories of factors influencing the choice of travel: cost, time, convenience, and social norm. However, travelers value these factors differently depending on their individual characteristics, such as age, income, work flexibility and environmental engagement, as well as on external factors, such as the weather. Moreover, instead of modeling the transport system explicitly, online web services are used to generate travel options. The model can support transport planners by providing estimations of modal share, as well as economical and environmental consequences. As a first step towards validation of the model, we have conducted a simple case study of three scenarios where we analyze the effects of changes to the public transport fares on commuters' travel choices in the Malm{\"o}-Lund region in Sweden.",

abstract="People process and communicate information at multiple levels of abstraction when reading, talking, solving problems, designing and interacting with computers. For example, in reading an article, actors may focus on a letter, a word, a clause, a sentence or a paragraph. At any moment, they focus on a particular level of abstraction, do something, and, under certain conditions, move back and forth to other levels until the actors achieve their goal. Not moving between levels of abstraction when necessary, decreases performance. It follows that human-computer interaction should be designed accordingly, yet there is hardly any explicit mention of abstraction levels in studies or guidelines of designing HCI. In this talk, I propose a method for incorporating abstraction levels in the design of HCI as a critical dimension of designing adaptive HCI. The talk demonstrates the ideas with examples of HCI for supporting online reading and group problem solving.",

abstract="The rise in low power devices has created a necessity for connectivity among systems, in some cases across great geographic lengths. Current wireless communication protocols for these devices cover only small areas or require several hops to communicate. LPWAN have surfaced to cover this necessity offering greater transmission range in energy efficient protocols. Among these can we find the LoRa technology, offering wide spread spectrum modulation for WSN. The most common implementations of LoRa work at 868Â MHz frequency range, and there is few information for other frequency bands. Given the nature of this modulation, it is of great interest to analyse lower frequencies. In this article a direct comparison of LoRa in the 868Â MHz and 433Â MHz will be done. Additionally, several parameters will be modified to find the best configuration available. This will help validate the possibility of transmitting at longer distances than current 868Â MHz implementations.",

abstract="In fast changing environments, companies and organizations have to continuously adapt their operating principles in response to new business or collaboration opportunities in order to remain competitive. The growing demand for high-quality services is taking organizations to format their operations to offer more personalized service packages and seek collaboration with other stakeholders. Moreover, provision of personalized services depends on frequent contextual information analysis. In the case of elderly care, the use of assistive technology is expected to have a positive contribution to the diversity of required services that support aging well. Demographic trends show that the percentage of elderly population is increasing, while ageing entails several limitations, calling for assistance services adapted to the specific needs of each person. These needs can evolve along the ageing process, requiring an evolution of the care services. In this paper, we make an overview of related concepts and propose a personalized and evolutionary care services model supported on collaborative networking, context-awareness and Internet of Things.",

CRUSOE addresses prerequisites associated with and interdependencies among (1) the strategy, (2) architecture and (3) organisation. Second, this paper describes a case study conducted as part of a smartphone platform project to investigate the CSE prerequisites for product-focused software development. The results are synthesised together with recent related studies using the CRUSOE framework. The findings confirm challenges in moving towards CSE in embedded system development. Moreover, context-specific prerequisites should be considered, while it is still unclear as to how CSE can be systematically applied to the non-website development context.",

pages="214--234",
abstract="Privacy-preserving data mining technologies have been studied extensively, and as a general approach, du Pin Calmon and Fawaz have proposed a data distortion mechanism based on a statistical inference attack framework. This theory has been extended by Erdogdu et al. to time-series data and been applied to energy disaggregation of smart-meter data. However, their theory assumes both smart-meter data and sensitive appliance state information are available when applying the privacy-preserving mechanism, which is impractical in typical smart-meter systems where only the total power usage is available. In this paper, we extend their approach to enable the application of a privacy-utility tradeoff mechanism to such practical applications. Firstly, we define a system model which captures both the architecture of the smart-meter system and the practical constraints that the power usage of each appliance cannot be measured individually. This enables us to formalize the tradeoff problem more rigorously. Secondly, we propose a privacy-utility tradeoff mechanism for that system. We apply a linear Gaussian model assumption to the system and thereby reduce the problem of obtaining unobservable information to that of learning the system parameters. Finally, we conduct experiments of applying the proposed mechanism to the power usage data of an actual household. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanism works partly effectively; i.e., it prevents usage analysis of certain types of sensitive appliances while at the same time preserving that of non-sensitive appliances.",

To address the knowledge gap, this study proposes a novel framework for trusted communication (TCF) drawn on the media characteristics perspective and theory construction methodology.

As a consequence a methodology evolves which explains the rise of morals in a society and at the same time identifies the factors that govern its internal dynamics. Especially, the influences of it-structures and technologies on the rise and change of morality can then be clearly understood.

abstract="Providing assurance that self-adaptive software meets its dependability, performance and other quality-of-service (QoS) requirements is a great challenge. Recent approaches to addressing it use formal methods at runtime, to drive the reconfiguration of self-adaptive software in provably correct ways. One approach that shows promise is runtime quantitative verification (RQV), which uses quantitative model checking to reverify the QoS properties of self-adaptive software after environmental, requirement and system changes. This reverification identifies QoS requirement violations and supports the dynamic reconfiguration of the software for recovery from such violations. More importantly, it provides irrefutable assurance evidence that adaptation decisions are correct. In this paper, we survey recent advances in the development of efficient RQV techniques, the application of these techniques within multiple domains and the remaining research challenges.",

The main objective of HMI is to fill the gap between human emotional states and the reaction of a computer in accordance with this feeling. However, there is a lack of mathematical emotional models to implement affective computing systems into real applications. Consequently, this paper explores the properties of the nonlinear methodology based on Quadratic Sample Entropy (QSE) for the recognition of different emotional subspaces. Precisely, 665 segments of 32-channel electroencephalographic recordings from 32 subjects elicited with different emotional stimuli have been analyzed to validate the proposed model. Results conclude that QSE is a promising feature to be taken into account. Indeed, this metric has reported a discriminant ability around 72{\%} using a support vector machine classifier. This result is comparable with the outcomes reported by other more complex methodologies which use multi-parametric analysis.",

Most rural areas of developing countries are not reached by the Web and its possibilities, while at the same time the ability to share knowledge has been identified as a key enabler for development. To make widespread knowledge sharing possible in these rural areas, the notion of the Web has to be downscaled based on the specific low-resource infrastructure in place. In this paper, we introduce SPARQL over SMS, a solution for Web-like exchange of RDF data over cellular networks in which HTTP is substituted by SMS. We motivate and validate this through two use cases in West Africa. We present the design and implementation of the solution, along with a data compression method that combines generic compression strategies and strategies that use Semantic Web specific features to reduce the size of RDF before it is transferred over the low-bandwidth cellular network.",

abstract="Environmental issues and consumer concerns have paved the way for governments to legislate and help usher into operation alternative-fueled vehicles and pertinent infrastructures. In the last decade, battery-powered electric vehicles have been introduced and the service industry has followed suit and deployed such trucks in their distribution networks. However, electric vehicles do impose limitations when it comes to their traveling range. Replenishing the power to the vehicle batteries may entail lengthy charging visits at respective stations. In this paper, we examine the problem of routing and scheduling a fleet of electric vehicles that seek to satisfy dynamic pickup and delivery requests in an urban environment. We develop a web application to facilitate cooperation between organizations and individuals involved in urban freight transport. The application uses geolocation services and mobile devices to help manage the fleet and make timely decisions. Moreover, we propose three heuristic recharging strategies to ensure that electric vehicles can restore their energy levels in an effective manner. Through detailed experimentation, we show that the costs associated with the use of an electric vehicle fleet concern mainly the size of the fleet. The impact regarding the total route length traveled is less evident for all our strategies.",

abstract="The Smart City is by now a model for the application of Future Internet services and infrastructure towards radical improvements of urban services in terms of efficiency and sustainability. In recent experiences in this area, however, a new vision is emerging that enriches the original concept with the human perspective, as gained through the application of citizen-centric and participatory approaches to the co-design and development of Smart City services. Indeed, it is becoming clear that ``smartness'' alone---sensors, metres, infrastructures---risks placing the citizen outside of the process, as a user who never takes the kind of ownership of the services that can only be ensured by engagement in their co-design from the very start. This paper explores the emergent model for Human Smart Cities, its methodological components, and the ``softer'' features of ``smartness''---such as clarity of vision, citizen empowerment, participation, etc.---which can complement the technological drive of the underlying urban infrastructure. Conclusions are set out in terms of implications and potential for EU policy renewal in the context of Europe 2020.",

Especially given the potential privacy and security risks arising from rapidly changing usage of information technology (IT), it can be useful to apply this notion also in the commercial world, relating to the actions of private organisations. However, accountability may be neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for trust. In order to provide an improved basis for trustworthiness via enhancing accountability, certain conditions need to be met. In this paper we elucidate what these conditions are and explain the related notion and importance of strong accountability. Further, we ground this analysis within the wider context of organisational ethical decision making.

abstract="This paper presents the FTA-MAC (Fast Traffic Adaptive MAC) protocol, a novel energy-efficient MAC protocol based on asynchronous duty cycling for Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). In FTA-MAC protocol, the communication between the sensor nodes is initiated by sending a wake-up beacon from the receiving node. The latter fast adapts its wake-up interval according to the traffic rate in order to reduce the idle listening of the transmitting nodes, which results in reducing the energy consumption. FTA-MAC protocol is implemented and evaluated in OMNeT++/Mixim network simulator. Simulation results show that FTA-MAC outperforms state-of-the-art protocols under fixed and variable traffic rates and also with multiple concurrent nodes. Thanks to this better wake-up schedule, the lifetime of a sensor node is increased 1.5 to 2 times.",

The qualitative study shows that the city of Hamburg defined a digital vision while the other two cities lacked setting such strategies. Bottom-up planning was their primary approach for smart city activities. Regarding the topic of participation we recognize that Hamburg can be recognized as a best practice example. Although the participatory practices were still in its infancy, they showed promising results. Remarkably, all three cities stress the importance of collaboration of different types of stakeholders.

abstract="Cooperative traffic control-systems have helped in the last years to extend the electronic horizon of vehicles in such a way that drivers can be informed quite in advance about any unexpected event occurring along a road. In this area, Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) perform information exchanges between vehicles by exploiting decentralized structures, where each vehicle is equipped with On Board Units (OBU) that allow to broadcast signals. In this paper, we revisit this communication framework by using a centralized approach, i.e., we consider a central unit for the data processing. This approach, on the one hand, facilitates the clustering process, thus obtaining the mitigation of the ``broadcast storm'' phenomenon (typically affecting VANETs); on the other hand, it allows the collection, management, and storage of the most relevant data concerning roads. Along the paper we evaluate the benefits of using our model, as well as we discuss on a smartphone integration.",

abstract="Semantic annotation technologies support the extraction of legal concepts, for example rights and obligations, from legal documents. For software engineers, the final goal is to identify compliance requirements a software system has to fulfill in order to comply with a law or regulation. That implies analyzing and annotating legal documents in prescriptive natural language, still an open problem for research in the field. In this paper we describe GaiusT 2.0, a system for extracting requirements from legal documents. GaiusT 2.0 is the result of the evolution of GaiusT, and has been designed and implemented as a web-based system intended to semi-automate the extraction process. Results of the application of GaiusT 2.0 show that the new version improves performance of the extraction process and also makes the tool more usable.",

We describe related work on context middleware and the niche CAKE is targeting. We also argue for taking privacy concerns into account and outline how our framework addresses such issues. The concepts behind CAKE are introduced, and we describe how reasoning engines based on different paradigms can be put to work together in our framework. A first take on end-user programming is outlined and a prototypical implementation of the system presented.",

Big data technologies describe a new generation of technologies and architectures, designed to economically extract value from very large volumes of a wide variety of data, by enabling high-velocity capture, discovery, and/or analysis. Fault tolerance is of great importance for big data systems, which have potential software and hardware faults after their development.

abstract="This paper examines a new application of the well-known ARP spoofing (or ARP cache poisoning) attack. Traditionally, ARP spoofing has been applied in local area networks to allow an attacker to achieve a man-in-the-middle position against target hosts, or to implement a denial of service by routing messages to non-existent hardware addresses. In this paper, we introduce a variant of ARP spoofing in which a routing loop is created in a target wireless ad hoc network. The routing loop not only results in a denial of service against the targeted hosts, but creates a resource consumption attack, where the targets waste power and occupy the channel, precluding its use by legitimate traffic. We show experimental results of an implementation and provide suggestions as to how to prevent, detect, or mitigate the attack.",

abstract="Nowadays, usage of the internet-of-things and oftenest of mobile phones, the technology, and networks of sensors has led to a huge and sudden increase in the amount of data commonly available in a streaming fashion. Online learning plays a vital role in classification which paves way for adaptive learning algorithm. Online multi-class imbalanced learning is a virgin problem that coalesces to the disputes of both online learning and multi-class imbalance learning. Sometimes the data streams for many applications like disease diagnosis, fraud detection, etc., may result in skewed class distribution. Many works in the literature are focused on online class imbalance learning with two-class problem. In this paper, a novel approach of EMOOB and EMUOB algorithms was proposed that overcome multi-class imbalance problem, where data comes in an online fashion. A comprehensive analysis was made in terms of class imbalance status, data distributions, imbalance rate, and in the performance of classifier. Based on the comprehension gained, two new ensemble methods EMOOB and EMUOB with adaptive weights are proposed in the name of WEOB.",

Cyber-foraging is a technique to enable mobile devices to extend their computing power and storage by offloading computation or data to more powerful servers located in the cloud or in single-hop proximity. This paper presents the preliminary results of a systematic literature review (SLR) on architectures that support cyber-foraging.

abstract="The proportion of elderly people over 65 years old has rapidly increased, and social costs related to aging population problems have grown globally. The governments want to reduce these social costs through advanced technologies. The physician or medical center evaluates health conditions from the reports of elderly people. However, self-reports are often inaccurate, and sometimes reports by family or caregivers can be more accurate. To solve these problems, an evaluated objective method based on sensor data is needed. In this paper, we propose a data-driven smart home system that uses web technologies for connecting sensors and actuators. The proposed system provides a method of monitoring elderly people's daily activities using commercial sensors to register recognizable activities easily. In addition, it controls actuators in the home by using user-defined rules and shows a summary of elderly people's activities to monitor them.",

However, we lack theoretically grounded fundamental metrics describing and characterizing this kind of human cognitive augmentation. The pursuit of such metrics leads us to some of the most fundamental questions about the nature of information and cognition. We define a cognitive process as the transformation of data, information, knowledge, or wisdom. We then employ representational information theory to calculate the effect a cognitive process has on the information. We then use that metric as the basis for deriving several other metrics such as cognitive gain, work, power, density, and efficiency to analyze a cognitively augmented human. We also propose a metric called the augmentation factor to indicate the level to which a human is augmented by working with one or more cognitive systems.",

Based on the definition and properties of SCOs, interviews and site visits are conducted to investigate how SCOs could be applied under different scenarios of the construction industry. Perspectives for future studies are proposed in order to fully realise their potentials. The research encourages a wider adoption of SCOs and smart technologies in improving current construction practices. It also provides academia with a platform for further exploring the innovative uses of SCOs in construction.",

abstract="Trust Evidence addresses the problem of how devices or systems should mutually assess trustworthiness at the onset and during interaction. Approaches to Trust Evidence can be used to assess risk, for example, facilitating the choice of threat posture as devices interact within the context of a smart city. Trust Evidence may augment authentication schemes by adding information about a device and its operational context. In this paper, we discuss Intel's 3-year collaboration with university researchers on approaches to Trust Evidence. This collaboration included an exploratory phase that looked at several formulations of Trust Evidence in varied contexts. A follow-up phase looked more specifically at Trust Evidence in software runtime environments, and whether techniques could be developed to generate information on correct execution. We describe various research results associated with two key avenues of investigation, programming language extensions for numerical Trust Evidence and an innovative protected module architecture. We close with reflections on industry-university researcher collaborations and several suggestions for enabling success.",

abstract="Frosts are one of the main causes of economic losses in the Province of Mendoza, Argentina. Although it is a phenomenon that happens every year, frosts can be predicted using Agricultural Monitoring Systems (AMS). AMS provide information to start and stop frosts defense systems and thus reduce economic losses. In recent years, the emergence of infrastructures called Sensor Clouds improved AMS in several aspects such as scalability, reliability, fault tolerance, etc. Sensor Clouds use Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) to collect data in the field and Cloud Computing to store and process these data. Currently, Cloud providers like Amazon offer different instances to store and process data in a profitable way. Moreover, due to the variety of offered instances arises the need for tools to determine which is the most appropriate instance type, in terms of execution time and economic costs, for running agro-meteorological applications. In this paper we present a model targeted to estimate the execution time and economic cost of Amazon EC2 instances for frosts prediction applications.",

Although data utilization contributes to advancing service, studies on the design of new service concepts using data are rare. The present study proposes a data-driven approach to designing new service concepts. The proposed approach is aimed at helping service designers to understand customer behaviors and contexts through data analysis and then generate new service concepts efficiently on the basis of such understanding. A case using bus driving data is introduced to illustrate the process of the proposed approach. The proposed approach provides a basis for the systematic design of new service concepts by enabling efficient data analysis.

The aim of this project is to reduce power consumption of data exchanging devices within houses. An optical fiber network is used for data transport to and from rooms whereas wireless transceivers communicate with appliances within the rooms. Using this approach, the aim is to reduce power consumption and exposure to electromagnetic radiation. To realize this, beamforming will be used to only radiate energy in, and receive signals from, the direction of interest. Because appliances within households can move, some of them even relatively fast, the pointing direction of the beam should be steerable. The pointing direction can be deduced from the communication link (beamsteering) or via separate mobile tracking techniques.",

abstract="The near real-time processing of continuous data flows in large scale sensor networks has many applications in risk-critical domains ranging from emergency management to industrial control systems. The problem is how to ensure end-to-end security (e.g., integrity, and authenticity) of such data stream for risk-critical applications. We refer this as an online security verification problem. Existing security techniques cannot deal with this problem because they were not designed to deal with high volume, high velocity data in real-time. Furthermore, they are inefficient as they introduce a significant buffering delay during security verification, resulting in a requirement of large buffer size for the stream processing server. To address this problem, we propose a Dynamic Key Length Based Security Framework (DLSeF) based on the shared key derived from synchronized prime numbers; the key is dynamically updated in short intervals to thwart Man in the Middle and other Network attacks. Theoretical analyses and experimental results of DLSeF framework show that it can significantly improve the efficiency of processing stream data by reducing the security verification time without compromising the security.",

This study explores the idea validation process of software startups in an attempt to understand the practices used for idea validation, discover how the process is affected by the founder's prior competencies, and determine the effect of those practices on requirement gathering. We conducted an exploratory multiple case study in nine software startups to determine the kind of practices they used for idea validation. We identified ten practices used as elements of the idea validation process. Our results show that idea validation is a highly non-linear process in which several validation practices are used in varying combinations and timing. The most frequently used practices included copying existing products, prototyping, utilizing expert support, and cooperating closely with customers. The founder's prior competencies also influenced the selected practices. Copying and prototyping were common practices when the founders had prior competencies in the application area, while utilizing expert support was a widespread practice to compensate for the founder's missing competencies. We also observed that the idea validation practices identified in the study serve requirement gathering at different levels of abstraction, varying from business-related requirements down to design-level requirements.",

abstract="Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have traditionally had static topologies that require little or no maintenance from their addressing mechanisms. New research directions have introduced additional scenarios where WSNs should adapt to the environment and network conditions. This shift in requirements also means that the addressing schemes should evolve dynamically, providing a distributed and lightweight way of assigning addresses to the sensor nodes. In addition, the routing protocols, which drive the information exchange within the network, must leverage the addressing properties in order to function efficiently. In this paper, we present Sequence Chain (SC) as a lightweight tree-based addressing mechanism for Wireless Sensor Networks. SC offers distributed and dynamic address allocation together with optimized tree routing. We compare our work with the de-facto industry standard, ZigBee, and show how SC improves the formation of addressing trees and yields up to three and a half times shorter multi-hop routes.",

Injecting context awareness into software systems has facilitated multiple facets of modelling, increasing user satisfaction, and increased the level of User Interface (UI) intelligence. Context has been a major part of traditional Artificial Intelligence (AI), lately however, it is being deployed to a wider spectrum of research topics such as human cognition, the internet of things, software usability and many others. In this paper, a new context-aware method for emergency applications is introduced. An emergency is a situation that poses an immediate risk to life, health, property or environment. There is an obvious gap in applying context to such critical cases; this paper shows that context awareness in user interfaces can play an important role with notifications and improving human reactions during such unfortunate and unforeseen incidents. The proposed method is evaluated through live emergency drills and simulations, the experimental results are presented.",

abstract="Wireless Mesh Networks (WMNs) are viewed as a cheap solution for telemetry networks in rural areas. The main advantages of WMNs are that they allow an easy extension of existing networks to service a wider area by using multi-hop wireless communication and they provide an alternate route when a route becomes faulty. Smart Rural Areas is a new concept for the development of rural areas. It is hypothesized that the Internet of Things (IoT) can help develop rural areas by providing better services resulting in poverty reduction. The widely used carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance (CSMA/CA) was originally designed for Wireless Local Area Networks (WLANs) consisting of single-hop transmissions. CSMA/CA experiences a rapid decrease in performance when applied to multi-hop distributed networks as an increase in collisions and contention for the medium is experienced. The IEEE 802.11e standard provides data differentiation services for data of different priority levels with enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) being used in contention based networks. With EDCA, an unfairness problem exists where high priority data can starve lower priority data. To address these problems in low-cost rural smart networks we investigate the performance of six design schemes for wireless backbone networks by assigning different roles to edge and core routers. Simulations were carried out to obtain the results using OMNeTÂ ++Â and the INET framework. Simulation results show that hybrid network designs using distributed coordination function (DCF) and EDCA can improve QoS.",

Quantitative verification, a powerful technique for analysing system models against quantitative properties such as ``the probability of a data packet being delivered within 1ms to a nearby Bluetooth device is at least 0.98'', has proved useful by detecting and correcting flaws in a number of ubiquitous computing applications. In this paper, we focus on three key aspects of ubiquitous computing: autonomous behaviour, constrained resources and adaptiveness. We summarise recent advances of quantitative verification in relation to these aspects, illustrating each with a case study analysed using the probabilistic model checker PRISM.

abstract="Exploration of ECG traces for their spectral characteristics, distinctly discloses a random component that pertains to the triggering of a new cardiac cycle in the inter-beat interval. Yet the stream consistently shows impressive reproducibility of its intrinsic core waveform. Respectively, the presence of close to deterministic structures firmly contends for representing a single cycle ECG wave by a state vector in a low dimensional embedding space. Rather than performing arrhythmia clustering directly on the high dimensional state space, our work first reduces the dimensionality of the extracted raw features. Analysis of heartbeat irregularities becomes then more tractable computationally and thus increasingly relevant to run on emerging wearable and IoT devices that are severely resource and power constraint. In contrast to prior work that constructs a two dimensional embedding manifold, we project feature vectors onto a three coordinate frame of reference. This merits an essential depth perception facet to a specialist that qualifies cluster memberships, and furthermore, by removing stream noise, we managed to retain a high percentile level of source energy. We performed extensive analysis and classification experiments on a large arrhythmia dataset, and report robust results to support the intuition of expert-neutral similarity.",

Nested event detection of RFID event stream is one of the most import class of queries. Current optimization of nested RFID event detection mainly considers caching intermediate results to reduce re-computation of similar results for nested subexpression. In this paper, we use context information of an RFID scenario to optimize nested event detection. We formalize context of an RFID scenario as spatial and temporal constraints and transform these constraints into rules over a nested NFA. Further, we present rewriting context rules to optimize nested event query plan. Experimental results show that with context information introduced, response time had been reduced greatly compared with counterpart methods.",

abstract="Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have become essential parts in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, owing to the type associated with data acquisition and the large scale of monitoring, sensors are often installed at a lot of locations and a wide variety of sensors make WSN topology more complex. To address these limitations, a complementary promising solution, known as software defined wireless sensor network (SDWSN), is proposed. SDWSN acquires desired information based on users' demands from large-scale sensor networks by dynamically customizing its function. Thanks to the SDWSN, multi-type data sensing is able to enlarge the sensing scale and reduce the cost. Existing sensor placement techniques are usually focus on simple function sensor or multi-type sensor. Witness the development of SDWSN, it is ideal to explore such abilities such that the multi-type sensing functions can be conducted in a same node. Because each area covered by different multi-function sensor nodes has different detection requirements, multi-function sensor nodes placement faces many challenges. In this paper, based on multi-objective decomposition, we study the number and function redundancy of all nodes minimization problem in multi-function sensor nodes placement. Specially, we propose an improved MOEA/D-DE algorithms based on orthogonal experiment design. Simulation and evaluations validate the efficiency of our proposal.",

abstract="Age estimation from faces is a challenging problem that has recently gained increasing relevance due to its potentially multi-faceted applications. Many current methods for age estimation rely on extracting computationally-demanding features from face images, and then use nonlinear regression to estimate the subject's age. This often requires matching the submitted face image against a set of face prototypes, potentially including all training face images, as in the case of kernel-based methods. In this work, we propose a super-sparse regression technique that can reach comparable performance with respect to other nonlinear regression techniques, while drastically reducing the number of reference prototypes required for age estimation. Given a similarity measure between faces, our technique learns a sparse set of virtual face prototypes, whose number is fixed a priori, along with a set of optimal weight coefficients to perform linear regression in the space induced by the similarity measure. We show that our technique does not only drastically reduce the number of reference prototypes without compromising estimation accuracy, but it can also provide more interpretable decisions.",

abstract="With the increasing complexity of the forms of the data (unstructured, massive, real-time, and heterogeneous), Distributed Data mining (DDM) approaches encounters a significant problem over grid infrastructure. The paper has identified a challenging problem i.e. an effective replica management which cost maximum resources to process the data from the warehouse in distributed data mining. The proposed system introduces a technique which presents a unique clustering mechanism of the data extracted from the replica (warehouse) and applies a novel statistical-based local model in order to extract the non-repetitive and unique data for accomplishing faster response time during distributed data mining. Powered by optimization using genetic algorithm, the proposed system offers better response time with increasing traffic load as compared to the similar existing technique of distributed data mining.",

The current understanding of the general requirements and theory behind this new class of systems is, however, still limited. This paper attempts to contribute towards their development by presenting a conceptual model that integrates some of the major ideas spread throughout the literature. In addition, it also discusses how the acquisition of a human's state requires reliable networking. In this respect, an architecture for HITL management of networking configurations is presented. This architecture is implemented in an experimental scenario where a smartphone system attempts to positively impact mood by dynamically adapting privacy settings and networking interfaces to the user's emotions. In this scenario, good hand-off performance is crucial for improving Quality of Experience and reliability. Several experiments regarding emotional classification and mobile handoff are also presented and discussed.",

abstract="South African communities are constantly being developed through new ICT projects which are initiated by individuals, government and private organisations. The problem with these developments is that they are implemented in isolation. This isolation causes limited sharing of resources, duplication, poor-governance of the resources and in worse-case scenarios, failure of project initiatives. This paper proposes a model that could be used to address these problems by focusing on the SEIDET community centre using it as an example. The model follows a descriptive analysis of ICT related work spanning over two decades performed within the SEIDET context, including the ongoing SEIDET Digital Village. The benefits of the proposed smart community centre model include community and rural development through sharing of scarce ICT resources. It could further provide support for entrepreneurs through training interventions, action-based research for policy development as well as spawn local innovation and free-sharing of resources and services.",

abstract="Cyber Security degree programs vary in scope; from those that are constructed around traditional computer science degrees with some additional security content, to those that are strongly focused on the need to develop a dedicated cyber security professional. The latter programs typically include a grounding in computer science concepts such as programming, operating systems and networks to specialised security content covering such disparate areas as digital forensics, information assurance, penetration testing and cryptography. The cyber security discipline as a whole faces new challenges as technology continues to evolve, and therefore significant changes are being faced by educators trying to incorporate the latest technological concepts into courses. This presents cybersecurity educators with a number of related challenges to ensure that changes to degree programs reflect not only the educational needs of students, but of the needs of industry and government. The evolving use of technology therefore presents both opportunities and problems, in how these changes are demonstrated in the curriculum. This paper highlights the accreditation, standards and guidelines (from three of the countries where the authors of this paper have sought accreditation) that shape the way educators are encouraged to develop and structure degree courses and considers these in lieu of factors relating to incorporating new technology in cybersecurity curriculum, particularly in the presentation of technical exercises to students.",

abstract="Events on the Web are increasingly being produced in the form of data streams, and are present in many different scenarios and applications such as health monitoring, environmental sensing or social networks. The heterogeneity of event streams has raised the challenges of integrating, interpreting and processing them coherently. Semantic technologies have shown to provide both a formal and practical framework to address some of these challenges, producing standards for representation and querying, such as RDF and SPARQL. However, these standards are not suitable for dealing with streams for events, as they do not include the concpets of streaming and continuous processing. The idea of RDF stream processing (RSP) has emerged in recent years to fill this gap, and the research community has produced prototype engines that cover aspects including complex event processing and stream reasoning to varying degrees. However, these existing prototypes often overlook key principles of reactive systems, regarding the event-driven processing, responsiveness, resiliency and scalability. In this paper we present a reactive model for implementing RSP systems, based on the Actor model, which relies on asynchronous message passing of events. Furthermore, we study the responsiveness property of RSP systems, in particular for the delivery of streaming results.",

abstract="Top-k query is one of important queries in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). It provides the k highest or lowest data collected in the entire network. Due to abundant resources and high efficiency, many future large-scale WSNs are expected to follow a two-tiered architecture with resource-rich master nodes. However, the sensor network is unattended and insecure. Since master nodes store data collected by sensor nodes and respond to queries issued by users, they are attractive to adversaries. It is challenging to process top-k query while protecting sensitive data from adversaries. To address this problem, we propose SET, a framework for secure and efficient top-k query in two-tiered WSNs. A renormalized arithmetic coding is designed to enable each master node to obtain exact top-k result without knowing actual data. Besides, a verification scheme is presented to allow the sink to detect compromised master nodes. Finally, theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm the efficiency, accuracy and security of our proposal.",

abstract="Achieving business excellence within industries which utilize complex technical systems requires effective and efficient maintenance. Maintenance is an important enabler of business performance. An effective maintenance strategy creates additional values in an organization's value-generating process. Establishing an effective and efficient maintenance process is highly dependent on supporting Information and Communication Technology (ICT) infrastructure for information logistics that facilitates maintenance decision support. eMaintenance solutions facilitate effective and efficient management and control of maintenance activities through an enhanced utilization of computing; like estimation of Remaining Useful Life (RUL); reduction of No-Fault Found (NFF); and prediction of fault. eMaintenance solutions enable a seamless integration and fusion of information services provided by information intensive systems with embedded components in order to manage increasing and extensively distributed real-time data collected via different data sources (e.g., sensors). Since, the emerging `Internet of Things' is expecting to dramatically change information systems with inherent embedded components, eMaintenance solutions need to be adapted to this new context to fulfill the overall business requirements on an effective and efficient decision-making process; for e.g.,: real-time analysis based on real-time data and context-aware information logistics. However, development and establishment of proper eMaintenance solutions can be facilitated through utilization of an appropriate framework which deals with real-world challenges.

Comfort preferences that are defined and stored on end-users mobile devices are subject to negotiations. The approach relies on a single trusted party operating as a public service in the ``security infrastructure as a service'' model. It is designed to assure resilience against attacks on users privacy from the side of service providers (SPs), user's attempts to use the services in an unauthorized manner, user's attempts to violate payment policies, as well as payment authority's attacks on privacy of users' payment patterns. From the SP perspective, the proposed approach minimizes the risk of unauthorized service usage, or denial of service attacks. All players benefit from the fast and secure micropayments allowing for pay-per-use model implementation, which is natural in ubiquitous services usage scenarios.",

abstract="The gateway of wireless sensor network (WSN) plays a key role in the network system. Its stability and reliability is very important to the WSN. The abnormal of gateway will make the network sequence disorder. The node can't report its data to the gateway, and it will need much more power consumption. In this paper, we propose a star topology network and the redundant node can monitor the node data and realize the gateway working status detection. We establish the relevant mathematical model based on the distance-based outlier detection method (DBODM) to analysis the gateway. When the deviation value is more than a certain threshold, the redundant node changes the nodes' working patterns through sending the intelligent decision message, to realize the node working in low power consumption.",

abstract="Over the past decade, several research initiatives have researched and proposed innovative solutions for transport logistics, but the level of adoption in the transport industry has been low, in particular in comparison with other industry sectors. This is on one side related to the transport industry itself, facing issues like market fragmentation, price pressure and a high degree of outsourcing, and on the other caused by a lack in dissemination strategies towards relevant stakeholders being indentified in several logistics innovation projects. The EU-funded project Loginn---Logistic Innovation Uptake aims at coordinating and supporting research, technology and development (RTD) projects in the logistics area to improve their capabilities to bridge the gap between pilot implementation and marketable solutions. At the same time, the project aims at disseminating innovative logistics practices, technologies and business models to the logistics community, thus establishing an information hub for logistics innovation and contributing to education and training of logistics enterprises' employees. Based on the research results, Loginn will develop a ``Logistics Innovation Action Plan'' for Europe.",

abstract="With the ever increasing device count and the introduction of wireless pervasive computing in building automation, in order 1) to enhance people life comfort and safety and 2) to optimize the consumption cost of public utility services like energy and water; it is becoming more than crucial to automatically manage these commonly known smart buildings. Indeed, in this research work, we propose a platform that addresses the problem of energy management of different electric devices in a smart Information and Communication Technology (ICT) building and particularly high performance computing (HPC) data centers. This platform integrates the mobile technology as a means to facilitate the maintenance operations usually executed by the mobile workforce agents on smart building electric devices. Another important issue integrated in this proposed platform deals with the monitoring of a life safety plan in case of an emergency scenario due, for instance, to fire detection. The emergency rescue monitoring is eased by the use of mobile devices such as the tablets, usually handled by people in a smart ICT building.",

Those applications can avail on data analysis and response capabilities, often empowered by Machine Learning algorithms, which can help clinician in diagnostic as well as therapeutic decisions. On the other hand, in the context of eSociety, eCommunities can be essential actors for managing and structuring medical data. In fact, they can support in gathering, providing and labeling data. This last task is highly relevant for medical Big Data, as it is a key point for supervised Machine Learning algorithms, which need an extensive data annotation process. This improves prediction and analysis capabilities of the algorithms on large datasets. Our approach on the medical Big Data labeling problem is the design and prototyping of a crowdsourcing collaborative Web Application, used for the annotation of medical images, that we named Medical Monkeys. Under the principles of mutual advantage and collaboration researchers, online gamers, medical students and patients will be involved, within this platform, in a virtual and mutually beneficial cooperation for improving Machine Learning algorithms. Using our application on large scale data analysis, algorithms for image segmentation will become useful for clinical decisions support systems. Our application is the result of a collaboration of several universities and research institutes and has, as principal aim, the integration, in form of gaming tasks, of eCommunities for the implementation of a more accurate analysis and diagnostic on MRI or CT images.",

abstract="Wireless sensor networks (WSN) are becoming extremely popular in the development of context aware systems. Traditionally WSN have been focused on capturing data, which was later analyzed and interpreted in a server with more computational power. In this kind of scenario the problem of representing the sensor information needs to be addressed. Every node in the network might have different sensors attached; therefore their correspondent packet structures will be different. The server has to be aware of the meaning of every single structure and data in order to be able to interpret them. Multiple sensors, multiple nodes, multiple packet structures (and not following a standard format) is neither scalable nor interoperable. Context aware systems have solved this problem with the use of semantic technologies. They provide a common framework to achieve a standard definition of any domain. Nevertheless, these representations are computationally expensive, so a WSN cannot afford them. The work presented in this paper tries to bridge the gap between the sensor information and its semantic representation, by defining a simple architecture that enables the definition of this information natively in a semantic way, achieving the integration of the semantic information in the network packets. This will have several benefits, the most important being the possibility of promoting every WSN node to a real semantic information source.",

Semantic representation of the sensor data directly addresses the problem of storing it in logical, easily accessible and extensible manner. Our paper works towards converting the already collected sensor data of the {\#}SmartME project into semantic format and also proposes real-time storage of semantically enriched sensor data. To build applications using these sensor data the authors consider mainly three kinds of sensors, i.e., Temperature, Humidity, Pressure. Predicting the observed value of any sensor data is the main aim of this work. The analysis leverages other sensors {\&} environmental parameters such as Date, Time, Longitude, Latitude, Altitude etc. Correlation among these parameters and the accuracy of the predicted results showed the suitability of our proposed idea.",

abstract="The iKaaS (intelligent Knowledge-as-a-Service) platform unitarily manages the data on existing cloud systems, which allows applications to access their desired data scattered all over the world transparently. Hidano et al. have proposed an access control mechanism suitable for the iKaaS platform to resolve privacy issues on the transfer of personal data to the applications in different countries. They introduced the concept of a privacy certificate authority (CA) to provide support for confirming the validity of the application. The privacy CA is established for each country as the executive agency responsible for the national regulations governing the handling of personal data. In this paper, we design a hierarchical model of multiple privacy CAs responsible for regulations where the areas governed by these regulations are different. The data transfer can be thereby controlled not only for different countries, but also for different economic or political blocs (e.g., European Union) or cities. In addition, focusing on a town management application as a use case of the iKaaS platform, we present how our access control mechanism works.",

abstract="Energy consumption is a major concern in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) since nodes are powered by batteries. Usually, batteries have low capacity and can not be replaced due to economic and/or logistical issues. In addition, batteries are complex devices as they depend on electrochemical reactions to generate energy. As a result, batteries exhibit non-linear behaviour over time, which makes difficult to estimate their lifetime. Analytical battery models are abstractions that allow estimating the battery lifetime through mathematical equations, taking into account important effects such as rate capacity and charge recovery. The recovery effect is very important since it enables charge gains in the battery after its electrochemical stabilization. Sleep scheduling approaches may take advantage of the recovery effect by adding sleep periods in the node activities in order to extend the network lifetime. This work aims to analyse the recovery effect within WSN context, particularly regarding low-power nodes. To do so, we use an analytical battery model for analysing the battery performance over time, during the node execution.",

Water distribution network needs an efficient modeling for the operation and maintenance with minimal errors in catering to the needs of people with the equitable amount of water through out the year. Creating a simulation model of a real time water distribution network with the account of the pressure and elevation to analyze the flow distribution between the nodes and demand in the network. Geographical information system is an effective tool for decision support using ArcGIS and Water-gems software. Here we tried to characterize the size of pipes with the different diameters of pipes used in the network. The results of the simulation model shows drastic change in the demands resulting in consequences like back-flow, high pressure zone and negative pressure leading to the leakage of pipes making more investment towards the installation and maintenance cost. Main aim of this research is to carry out hydraulic modelling of water distribution network using GIS and reducing the leakage in the pressure zones in saving the time and to minimize the expenditure towards the maintenance. Thus by creating an equity model for the water distribution network in fulfilling minimal demand required across the city.",

abstract="In the last decade, social network analytics and related data analysis methodologies have helped big players gain enormous influence on the web, largely due to clever centralistic data collection in major data lakes. In the form of recommender systems, this can also be seen as world-scale group decision support. In our research, we have been more interested in how these kinds of technologies can spill over to smaller-scale communities of interest in the long tail of the internet. Examples include learning communities and open source software development communities of individuals, but also questions of controlled data and knowledge sharing among small and medium enterprises or medical institutions. Especially in the latter cases, we often face strongly conflicting goals that need to be negotiated to mutually acceptable solutions, quite along the original GDSS and NSS visions of Mel Shakun and colleagues. One example is medical research support on rare diseases which raises the need for data sharing across multiple health organizations (not necessarily being fond of each other) in a fully transparent, fraud-resistant research process while preserving best-possible privacy of patient data. We end with a summary of the Industrial Data Space initiative recently proposed by Fraunhofer which aims at architectures, rules and tools for data sovereignty in cross-organizational data management and analytics.",

In this exploratory research based on a grounded theory approach, we developed a framework showing relationships between privacy awareness, hardware types, end-of-life handling, and data protection measures. Based on the sample data, we identified types of hardware that are experienced as being critical storage devices, whereas the storage capacity of others is not perceived as being critical. Based on the framework, research could beginÂ to further elaborate solutions to this problem.

Especially, the BLE shows promising results in different fields such as Internet of Things (IoT), health-care, body area networks, etc. As a result of dramatic increase in the wireless device, the frequency interference in 2.4Â GHz Industrial Scientific Medical (ISM) band has raised, resulting a higher packet loss. In this paper, we propose Fast Adaptive Frequency Hopping Scheme (FAFH) to mitigate the effects of interference in BLE. The proposed FAFH scheme immediately hops to a new channel without waiting for completion of the current connection event when the channel quality becomes worse by interference. The simulation results show that the FAFH performs better in dense wireless networks as well as improved performances comparing to AFH scheme.",

abstract="Smartphones are widely available commercial devices and using them as a basis to creates the possibility of future widespread usage and potential applications. This paper utilizes the embedded sensors in a smartphone to recognise a number of common human actions and postures. We group the range of all possible human actions into five basic action classes, namely walking, standing, sitting, crouching and lying. We also consider the postures pertaining to three of the above actions, including standing postures (backward, straight, forward and bend), sitting postures (lean, upright, slouch and rest) and lying postures (back, side and stomach) . Training data was collected through a number of people performing a sequence of these actions and postures with a smartphone in their shirt pockets. We analysed and compared three classification algorithms, namely k Nearest Neighbour (kNN), Decision Tree Learning (DTL) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) in terms of classification accuracy and efficiency (training time as well as classification time). kNN performed the best overall compared to the other two and is believed to be the most appropriate classification algorithm to use for this task. The developed system is in the form of an Android app. Our system can real-time accesses the motion data from the three sensors and on-line classifies a particular action or posture using the kNN algorithm. It successfully recognizes the specified actions and postures with very high precision and recall values of generally above 96Â {\%}.",

We see three major shortcomings of many current approaches of enabling enterprises to adapt under these conditions: the proposed processes and systems often do not deal with the whole context surrounding the enterprise; enterprises still follow rather deliberate approaches when dealing with strategy and its execution; and decisions are limited in terms of their reach and range. Complex adaptive systems, and in particular autonomic systems, provide concepts and principles that could be leveraged to address these challenges. Furthermore, agent oriented implementation approaches could be harnessed to realise contextually aware and adaptive enterprise systems.

To keep the driver focused, the user interface consists of a small non-invasive display combined with a speech recognition system. System architecture is optimized for aggressive power management, featuring an ultra-low power wake-up radio, and fine-grained software-controlled shutdown of all sensing, communication and computing sub-systems. Finally, a multi-source energy harvesting module (solar and kinetic) performs high-efficiency power recovery, improving battery management and achieving self-sustainability.

Most people are busy with daily-basis activities, but elders tend to walk more and, therefore, they develop expertise on the traffic state and/or the presence of works going on the roads. Our driving ides is to take advantage of the knowledge that elderly can gather. For example, a tourist can go sightseeing in a new city by using an elder's advice. When decisions are based on information collected from other individual, trust management is a key problem.

Correlations between seated rest and seated rest on a massage chair were low, indicating that the power of alpha brain waves decreased as R-R interval (RRI) increased. However, this study did not show correlations between seated restÂ +Â the auditory 2-back task and seated rest on the massage chair. RRI and the power of alpha waves during tasks changed depending on whether the participant was relaxed or engaged in brain activity, with an inverse correlation between the two factors. The relationship between EEG and ECG findings at rest and during brain activity reflects the relationship between the central and autonomic nervous systems at rest.",

abstract="Chip fabrication technologies evolve at an explosive rate. Notwithstanding, we analyze that attacks on smartcard chips are almost not impacted: only the architecture which gets more complex (e.g., the devices transition from mono- to multi-core) and the advanced design solutions (adaptative voltage and frequency scaling, multiple clock domains, asynchronicity, etc.) somehow make attacks slightly more complex. The situation is different for chips tightly integrated in embedded devices, such as smartphone chips. Indeed, the chips size and complexity increase drastically, and thus attacks identification phase becomes extremely hard. In addition, the chip targetted by the attacks is usually stacked with other chips (like the memory), which makes access to leakages and injection of faults a challenging task. Therefore, we conclude that there is a clear gain of security in the future to use smartphones as secure elements. Attacks at printed circuit board level associated with signal processing and machine learning could question this conclusion. Also, as a perspective, we notice that new kinds of attacks become possible on smartphones. Those devices being intrinsically connected, the new side-channel and fault injection attacks are realized not physically, but in software (controlled from an external center attack process): such attacks are called microarchitectural cache timing attacks (regarding side-channels) and RowHammer attacks (regarding fault injections). We predict increasing progress in those cyberattack threats.",

abstract="The last decade has seen a considerable increase of online shops for fashion goods. Technological advancements, improvements in logistics, and changes in buyer behavior have led to a dissemination of apparel goods and respective data on the Web. In numerous domains of knowledge management, ontologies have proven to be very useful for sharing meaning among organizations and individuals, and for inferencing. With schema.org, there already exists a collection of widely accepted Web vocabularies for the fields of gastronomy, accommodation, entertainment, sports, or products. Yet, schema.org still lacks a dedicated fashion ontology, which would allow for greater interoperability, higher visibility, and better comparison of fashion products on the Web. In this paper, we design and evaluate a Web ontology for garments as a compatible extension of schema.org. For our proposal, we take into account current best practices of Web ontology engineering, we formally evaluate our conceptual model, and we present practical use cases. We further contextualize our work by comparing our approach with state-of-the-art vocabularies for the fashion industry.",

The objective of the research to evaluate the benefits and challenges of building IT systems using a RA. We do this by investigating cases of the utilization of a RA for Linked Open Statistical Data (LOSD). Benefits of using the reference architecture include reducing project complexity, avoiding having to ``reinvent the wheel'', easing the analysis of a (complex) system, preserving knowledge (e.g. proven concepts and practices), mitigating multiple risks by reusing proven building blocks, and providing users a common understanding. Challenges encountered include the need for communication and learning the ins and outs of the RA, missing features, inflexibility to add new instances as well as integrating the RA with existing implementations, and the need for support for the RA from other stakeholders.",

abstract="We propose and evaluate an approach for the estimation of the energy consumption of sensor nodes in IoT sensing applications. The approach is based on the identification of distinct activity phases that sensor nodes repeatedly execute. The power consumption of these activity phases is measured before the nodes are deployed. The total energy consumption at runtime is then estimated by combining the measured values with timestamps captured at runtime. Therefore, the approach can take runtime adaptations of the application behavior, as necessary for adaptive sensing, into account, but without involving complex hardware measurements of power consumption at runtime. We show that the error of the estimation for selected applications is low (max. observed was 2.438{\%}), which makes the approach very suitable for energy-aware, adaptive sensing.",

abstract="Scalable data processing platforms built on cloud computing are becoming increasingly attractive as infrastructure for supporting big data mining and analytics applications. But privacy concerns are one of the major obstacles to make use of public cloud platforms. Practically, data generalisation is a widely adopted anonymisation technique for data privacy preservation in data publishing or sharing scenarios. Multidimensional anonymisation, a global-recoding generalisation scheme, has been a recent focus due to its capability of balancing data obfuscation and data usability. Existing approaches handled the scalability problem of multidimensional anonymisation for data sets much larger than main memory by storing data on disk at runtime, which incurs an impractical serial I/O cost. In this paper, we propose a scalable iterative multidimensional anonymisation approach for big data sets based on MapReduce, a state-of-the-art large-scale data processing paradigm. Our basic and intuitive idea is to partition a large data set recursively into smaller data partitions using MapReduce until all partitions can fit in memory of each computing node. A tree indexing structure is proposed to achieve recursive computation on MapReduce for data partitioning in multidimensional anonymisation. Experimental results on real-life data sets demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly improve the scalability and time-efficiency of multidimensional anonymisation over existing approaches, and therefore is applicable to big data applications.",

abstract="Shared ledger technologies, as exemplified by Blockchain, provide a new framework for supporting business collaborations that is based on having a high-reliability, shared, trusted, privacy-preserving, nonrepudiable data repository that includes programmable logic in the form of ``smart contracts''. The framework has the potential to dramatically transform business collaboration across numerous industry sectors, including finance, supply chain, food production, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare. Widespread adoption of this technology will be accelerated by the development of business-level languages for specifying smart contracts. This paper proposes that data-aware business processes, and in particular the Business Artifact paradigm, can provide a robust basis for a shared ledger Business Collaboration Language (BCL). The fundamental rationale for adopting data-aware processes is that shared ledgers focus on both data and process in equal measure. The paper examines potential advantages of the artifact-based approach from two perspectives: conceptual modeling, and opportunities for formal reasoning (verification). Broad research challenges for the development, understanding, and usage of a shared ledger BCL are highlighted.",

However in this field there is a huge gap between technology accumulation and technology application, i.e. technology application far falling short of accumulation. It is this huge gap that creates a lot of entrepreneurial opportunities for Chinese firms. Generally speaking, technology applications firstly depend on discovery of social problems as well as design of their solutions, thus most of entrepreneurial opportunities are social-problem oriented in essence. The authors, taking these tendencies into account in this article, deeply analyze the definition, characteristics and identification of entrepreneurial opportunities in digital economy, compare US Apple Corporate and China Changhong Corporate, and stress necessity of shifting the focus of innovation from technology orientation to a social-problem one. So in the huge markets of China, social problems should always be aimed at first, and customer demands found second, and solutions designed third, and finally key resources integrated for development of these solutions. It is believed that in digital economy this social-problem oriented innovation process can provide more entrepreneurial opportunities as well as more innovative products and services for innovators to construct dominant application paradigms, so to win battles of new technology commercialization.",

abstract="The paradigm shift from the current energy consumption model towards a sustainable model requires to develop new behaviors and strategies. This is particularly relevant in domains like the public transport. Many providers are currently offering services to assist passengers to plan their routes. However, these approaches are often restricted to some specific area or transport medium. We suggest using a Linked Data perspective, which makes simpler to combine data from different sources, as well as extending and managing them. Moreover, it makes possible to enrich the basic model to the extent of developing a knowledge model, able to use semantic techniques to unfold even better strategies. In this paper we present a proposal in the transport domain, which refines a basic model into a Transmodel specification and later adds more information according to the IFOPT model. This defines a knowledge model, which can be used to develop sustainable transport strategies.",

abstract="The current proliferation of ubiquitous networking (e.g. WiFi, bluetooth) along with the high penetration of the pervasive devices (smart phones, tablets) have provided a substantial boost to life-logging; a framework for the every-day recording of sensitive and personal data of individuals. Life-logging systems usually consist of resource-constrained devices (sensors). Moreover, as for every emerging technology, life-logging is susceptible to a number of security threats. In this paper, we implement and evaluate a joint encryption and compression scheme using the current advances in compressed sensing theory. The evaluation shows that the reconstruction error is kept low even for high compression ratios, and the power consumption of the life-logging system significantly reduces.",

abstract="Indoor location-based application and services have drawn businesses attention as they have shown advances in conjunction with a growing importance of ubiquitous computing and context-dependent information. However, current systems have serious problems in terms of privacy since attackers can track users by analyzing information captured from the network such as MAC addresses. In this situation, this work provides a practical solution to the privacy issue in indoor positioning systems. We propose the usage of pseudo-certificates issued by third-party authorities for anonymous auhentication of mobile devices. The proposed scheme provides privacy to users while providing governmental authorities the possibility to analyze the historical position of users when they are required. The proposed anonymous authentication system offers highest level of security while maintain minimal cryptographic overhead.",

abstract="Next-generation networks are witnessing a convergence of wired and wireless technologies towards a ubiquitous computing paradigm. Wireless Sensor Networks are leading this revolution, but their deployment is delayed mainly because of energy constraints. Sensor nodes are typically equipped with non-rechargeable batteries, thus energy consumption must be minimized. In this paper, an energy-efficient communication protocol, compliant with the ZigBee standard, is proposed and validated. In particular, a new algorithm is discussed that efficiently tunes the duty cycle of a node, i.e., the cycling between an awake and a sleep state of the radio transceiver. After a preliminary communication, each node knows the transmission times of its neighbors and thus when it can switch its radio off since it is not going to receive any message. The solution is robust and has low processing and storage capacity requirements. Simulation results have demonstrated substantial improvements in power consumption compared to the ZigBee standard.",

abstract="Security and privacy requirements in ubiquitous systems need a sophisticated policy language with features to express access restrictions and obligations. Ubiquitous systems involve multiple actors owning sensitive data concerning aspects such as location, discrete and continuous time, multiple roles that can be shared among actors or evolve over time. Policy consistency is an important problem in languages supporting these aspects. In this paper we present an abstract language (AAL) to specify most of these security and privacy features and compare it with XACML. We also classified the existing conflict detection mechanisms for XACML in dynamic, testing, or static detection. A thorough analysis of these mechanisms reveals that they have several weaknesses and they are not applicable in our context. We advocate for a classic approach using the notion of logical consistency to detect conflicts in AAL.",

abstract="Older people would like to live independently in their home as long as possible. They want to reduce the risk of domestic accidents because of polypharmacy, physical weakness and other mental illnesses, which could increase the risks of domestic accidents (i.e. a fall). Changes in the behaviour of healthy older people could be correlated with cognitive disorders; consequently, early intervention could delay the deterioration of the disease. Over the last few years, activity recognition systems have been developed to support the management of senior citizens' daily life. In this context, this paper aims to go beyond the state-of-the-art presenting a proof of concept where information on body movement, vital signs and user's indoor locations are aggregated to improve the activity recognition task. The presented system has been tested in a realistic environment with three users in order to assess the feasibility of the proposed method. These results encouraged the use of this approach in activity recognition applications; indeed, the overall accuracy values, amongst others, are satisfactory increased (+2.67{\%} DT, +7.39{\%} SVM, +147.37{\%} NN).",

abstract="Early detection of faults is essential to maintaining the reliability of a distributed system. While there are many solutions for detecting faults, handling high dimensionality and uncertainty of system observations to make an accurate detection still remains a challenge. In this paper, we address this challenge with a two-dimensional convolutional neural network in the form of a denoising autoencoder with recurrent neural networks that performs simultaneous fault detection and diagnosis based on real-time system metrics from a given distributed system (e.g. CPU usage, memory consumption, etc.). The model provides a unified way to automatically learn useful features and make adaptive inferences regarding the onset of faults without hand-crafted feature extraction and human diagnostic expertise. In addition, we develop a Bayesian change-point detection approach for fault localization, in order to support the fault recovery process. We conducted extensive experiments in a real distributed environment over Amazon EC2 and the results demonstrate our proposal outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms that are used for fault detection and diagnosis in distributed systems.",

The real success is coming from small services which exploit the elasticity and availability of cloud resources to become available to hundreds and millions of users, many of which are using mobile devices. However, little or no progress has been made in developing new architectures that exploit the capabilities offered by cloud and mobile computing. In this paper, the cloud-enabled mobile devices concept is defined, making an overview of the related fields. People-as-a-Service is proposed as a new service model based on that concept, describing a high level architecture to support it, and presenting a business application based on this technology. As a result, cloud-enabled mobile devices promote the emergence of new scenarios and mobile applications based on new architectures where devices can act both as clients and servers.",

abstract="Mobility is necessary to participate on day-to-day life, but comes along with negative implications on our environment. A change in our mobility behavior caused by the growing digitalization and arise of new mobility services is essential to reduce the environmental impact of our mobility. To achieve such goal, new services with a strengthened competition has to be established. In addition, sharing of workforce and operating supplies between companies are addressed to adopt new business models. B2B sharing, including occasional workers, has huge potential to generate new services and business models, especially in the service sector. The described approach of a mobility broker provides such a tool for sharing between businesses, but also between businesses and occasional working persons in the field of mobility services.",

abstract="Everybody is now addicted to the online social media. Social media sites have been used by millions of people globally. Each individual expresses his thoughts, daily life events, and opinions on social media. The individual's expressions on social media are mostly in the text form. The text contains sentiments, opinions, attitudes and emotions of the individuals, which are largely related to the happiness in the personal life of individuals. Extensive usage of social media affects the happiness, which can be either on the positive or negative level. Happiness level is normally measured by self-report and often been indirectly characterized by more readily quantifiable economic indicators such as gross development product (GDP) or genuine progress indicator (GPI). However, the growing importance of linguistic text analysis of social media gives a direction to predict the happiness of individuals and is termed as subjective well-being (SWB). SWB is the scientific term used to describe happiness and quality of life of individuals. It includes emotional reactions and cognitive judgments and is of great use to public policy-makers as well as economic, sociological, and psychological research. The richness and availability of social media make it an ideal platform to conduct psychological research in the topic SWB. In this paper, at last, the evidence of the importance of the social media analytics has been provided followed by identification of major factors involved in SWB. Further, the effects of social media usage on the SWB of individuals have been elaborated.",

However, the design constraints, the behavior requirements and the error prone nature, make the development of WSNs and their deployment an extremely challenging task. The Model Driven Engineering (MDE) approach helps tackling these issues by using models and automatic transformation to generate code or analyze WSNs against their requirements. In this paper, we propose a systematic mapping study which presents the existing WSNs MDE-based modeling languages. We surveyed a total of 1852 papers from which we selected 21 languages satisfying 7 selection criteria. We analyze these languages according to 5 rigorous research questions and 12 comparative criteria. Then we provide a precise view on the existing languages and their weaknesses mainly regarding mobility and data fusion.

abstract="Sociomateriality is gaining momentum and is by now characterized as a research stream in the information system field. Although some definitions emerged, there is still uncertainty about how to conceptually and analytically address sociomateriality. The debate ranges from understanding sociomateriality as just a fancy word for technology to treating it as a de-facto theory of the human-technology relationship. To bring the field forward, a common basic understanding of what sociomateriality entails is needed. In this paper we set out to contribute to such an understanding. We do this by conducting a systematic mapping study of emerging concepts and definitions in the current empirical body of literature on sociomateriality. Our analysis finds three key resulting facets: mutuality (what is a sociomaterial assemblage?), performativity (how does it perform?), and multidimensionality (When and where does it perform?). Our findings outline how sociomaterial studies analytically and methodologically address performativity spanning across time and space.",

abstract="We present the design and evaluation of Panoramic, a tool that enables end-users to specify and verify an important family of complex location events. Our approach aims to reduce or eliminate critical barriers to deployment of emerging location-aware business activity monitoring applications in domains like hospitals and office buildings. Panoramic does not require users to write code, understand complex models, perform elaborate demonstrations, generate test location traces, or blindly trust deterministic events. Instead, it allows end-users to specify and edit complex events with a visual language that embodies natural concepts of space and time. It also takes a novel approach to verification, in which events are extracted from historical sensor data traces and then presented with intelligible, hierarchical visualizations that represent uncertainty with probabilities. We build on our existing software for specifying and detecting events while enhancing it in non-trivial ways to facilitate event specification and verification. Our design is guided by a formative study with 12 non-programmers. We also use location traces from a building-scale radio frequency identification (RFID) deployment in a qualitative evaluation of Panoramic with 10 non-programmers. The results show that end-users can both understand and verify the behavior of complex location event specifications using Panoramic.",

abstract="Security is not one of the key features of big data platforms and data security in these systems was not thought from scratch. Though it is of utmost importance, in most systems, not even the most basic security mechanisms are enabled and configured. Big Data systems store and process millions of confidential information from people all over the world: credit cards, addresses, health data, financial data, etc. Apache Hadoop, one of most popular big data platforms, stores important amounts of data that is also subject to attacks. The main problem is that, by default, these platforms do not have active security and there is no valid and reliable authentication model, which makes them vulnerable to internal attacks. In this paper, we assess the importance of security mechanisms and how they are currently configured on big data platforms. We also evaluate the impact of encryption mechanisms in these platforms.",

abstract="Context-aware computing is one of the key research issues in smart business applications, IoT paradigm and it is evident that it is successful in understanding the data sensed from trading environment. The success of trading depends on providing the proper personalized services to the trader based on his current context. The challenge here is to design and develop a context aware model which extracts meaningful information from raw data generated from underlying physical world. When there exists right information at right time it is possible to make effective decisions. This paper, proposes a C-IOB (Context-Information, Observation, Belief) hierarchical graphical structure model which signifies a causal relationship between low level context and high level context to reason about the customer and vendor context based beliefs. The proposed model provides accurate service with minimum computation and also reduces solution search space since the context information of a business entity is synthesized in the form of beliefs. Our research findings indicate the importance of the context based belief model in developing innovative Forex applications.",

However, traditional monitoring system is based on cable data acquisition that has many disadvantages. Nowadays, GPRS is the most commonly accepted way for wireless transmission. Based on it, a type of low energy consumption RTU is developed and applied. In this paper, details of the design are introduced. In hardware design of this type of RTU, STM8L152 is selected in the MCU module to accomplish the function of ultralow power consumption, and solar battery is designed to solve the problem of power supply. In software design of the RTU, the sleep/online mode conversion is programed to reduce the energy consumption. It is comparatively low-priced and can detect necessary parameters for aquaculture. Performances of the RTU are tested in experimental stations and compared with two advanced water quality analyzers. Results show that it shows almost the same variation characteristics as those of HACH and YSI.",

abstract="Energy saving is the paramount factor in the evolving Internet of Things (IoT) due to limited battery energy in the devices. An IoT device in anomaly condition will lead to transmission failure and power drain. It is imperative to detect the anomaly, whose occurrence is random in nature over time. The randomness in failure needs a statistical model of an IoT device to predict and stop the occurrence of anomaly. We propose a novel approach of modeling IoT devices as a finite state automaton, which is irreducible, a priori, has well determined emissions (refers to received signal strength) and finite hidden state space. We have designed a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) based approach to efficiently predict anomaly using which we orchestrate the time interval between successive transmissions from an IoT device. Experimental results reveal that our approach can determine anomaly of IoT device with accuracy as high as 98{\%}. The higher anomaly detection rate results in saving around 14{\%} of IoT device battery power by avoiding redundant transmissions.",

abstract="Wireless sensor networks are formed of thousands of nodes that need to be deployed to maintain good sensing coverage area. Deployment of a wireless sensor network in a hostile or hazardous environment is a challenging problem. To address this problem, a bundle of sensors to be deployed is initially placed in a definite region within the area of the network. Then the sensor nodes are diffused cooperatively and gradually to increase coverage area. This paper proposes a self-deployment heuristic approach for WSN based on the Four Quadrants Deployment Model (FQDM). It studies the effect of applying a realistic energy model to FQDM, and proposes an extended version of FQDM to enhance the coverage at border areas. The proposed approach relocates the sensors in a way that maximizes the coverage while minimizing energy consumption. Results show that it gives a good coverage for definite region while conserving energy of sensors.",

abstract="In hybrid energy harvesting sensor networks, there is a trade-off between the cost of data collection by a wireless sink and the timeliness of the collected data. The trade-off further depends on the energy harvesting capability of the sensor nodes as sensors cannot transmit data if they do not have sufficient energy. In this paper, we propose an analytic model for assessing the value of the information that a sensor node brings to decision making. We account for the timeliness of data by discounting the value of the information at the sensor over time and adopt the energy-chunk approach (i.e. discretise the energy level) to track energy harvesting and expenditure over time. Finally, by numerical experiments, we study the optimal data collection rate for the sensor node at hand.",

abstract="Low cost ad hoc networks like Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) are best suited to gather sensory information. Sensitivity of these classified information leads to the necessity of implementing security protocols during their exchange. Such implementations use cryptosystems that may suit resourceful Internet of Things (IoT) devices; but overburdens tiny sensors. Moreover most protocols assume that an adversary is well versed with all system information, barring the cryptographic keys. As such the (fixed) operational frequency bands between a given pair of nodes is assumed to be known at all times. Such a strong assumption may not be always necessary in real life deployment zones. In fact tracking an operational frequency between sensors from a range of bands may be difficult in a large networkÂ [15]; though not hard. This leads to a hard problem, i.e., to keep track of recursive switch of operational frequencies between a given pair of sensors for consecutive timestamps. We exploit hardness of this problem to achieve confidentiality of message exchange between pairs of nodes. Message to be transmitted is split using secret sharing techniqueÂ [18]. Each piece is then transmitted via different bands obtained by recursive use of cryptographic hash function on initial preallocated bands. Our approach does not consume extra energy during message transmission or receipt in comparison to existing wireless systems. Storage requirement is minimized to storage of hash functions; no cryptographic key stored. Security achieved is comparable to any existing cryptosystem.",

abstract="Currently, the problem of efficient gathering and analysis of heterogeneous data from public Internet sources is relevant to many companies working with social issues. Also it applies to the task of building a social profile for the subsequent person identification. This paper addresses the issues of direct and indirect identification a person on the Internet as well as data structure development to store the static and dynamic information of a personal social profile. The article considers the basic options of personal network identification such as an identification by profiling data, IDs, personal websites and blogs, accounts in social networks, e-mail addresses and links from other resources. After identifying it is necessary to collect and structure the detected data about a person. For this purpose, the authors proposed a basic data structure divided into static and dynamic parts. The static part is represented in the form of a relational database and contains immutable data that uniquely identify a specific human (for example, name and surname, completed educational institutions, career, curriculum vitae etc.). The dynamic part is organized as a NoSQL store and accumulates all the information about the current human activity in the network (for examples, accounts in social networks, network friends, current preferences when buying products, preferences when visiting network resources, political and social beliefs etc.).",

A parking preference adopted in the model involves not only parking fee, but also time required for parking, space waiting, and destination to the space allocated. This model advances and optimizes the usage of parking lots, also satisfying individual parking requirements. Unlike other studies acting solely with vacant parking spaces, this one also applies toÂ parking lots with full state to the assignment of parking space to each parking request, while each of the lots has the probability of releasing occupied spaces soon. TheÂ request a vehicle parking space corresponds to the parking fee and time consumption of related parking operations.

abstract="The presence of personal financial data, intellectual property, and classified documents on University computer systems makes them particularly attractive to hackers, but not well prepared for their attacks. The University of Rhode Island (URI) is one of the few institutions collecting network traffic data (NetFlow) for inference and analysis of normal and potentially malicious activity. This research focuses on web-based traffic with client-server architecture and adopts simple probability-based transmission models to explore the vulnerability of the URI web-network to anticipated threats. The fact that the URI firewall captures only traffic data in- and out- of URI necessitates the modeling of internal un-observed traffic. Relying on a set of intuitive assumptions, we simulate the spread of infection on the dynamic bipartite graph inferred from observed external and modeled unobserved internal web-browsing traffic and evaluate the susceptibility of URI nodes to threats initiated by random clients and clients from specific countries. Overall, the results suggest higher rates of infection for client nodes compared to servers with maximum rates achieved when infection is initiated randomly. Remarkably, very similar rates are observed when infection is initiated from 100 different clients from each of selected countries (e.g., China, Germany, UK) or from one most active node from Denmark. Interestingly, the daily analysis over a three-month period reveals that the simulated infection rates that are not consistent with the intensity of the flow traffic may indicate the presence of compromised node activity and possible intrusion.",

abstract="Due to the rapid change in the residential style, about 70{\%} of the population of South Korea reside in multi-unit dwelling today. As many people share the same building as a residential area, the neighboring interlayer noise problem becomes a serious social problem leading to murder, arson attack, etc. However, it is practically impossible to improve the buildings or introduce new building technologies to ones already built to prevent the inter floor noise. When noise occurs, there are no appropriate system or laws for people to impose special sanctions on the perpetrator. Most solutions are either too long in terms of process or indirect. It is necessary to have a process, which solves the problem directly and continuously. The survey results, that targeted people living in apartment houses, show that perpetrators are not aware of the actions that cause noises. Not only that, results show both victim and noise attacker's lack of awareness of precise standards of interested noise. Above all, anyone living in the apartment houses can be a victim or a perpetrator of inter floor noise problem. Therefore, this study proposes a service in which the perpetrators can monitor, manage and supervise interlayer noises that they create. This service will help perpetrators be more keen to their own noise, ultimately preventing problems caused by interlayer noises. Through the service, it is expected that the number of victims suffering from the noise will be decreased and ultimately, the inter-floor noise complaint rate, which is increasing every year, will be reduced so it prevents neighbor's conflicts and disputes.",

Network becomes more beneficial to an application when it can be used to its full potential, which is difficult to achieve because of limitations of resources (processor, memory, and energy). There are many existing routing mechanisms which deal with these issues by reducing number of transmissions between sensor nodes by choosing appropriate path toward base station. In this paper, we propose a routing protocol to select the optimized route by using opportunistic theory and by incorporating appropriate sleep scheduling mechanisms into it. This protocol focuses on reduction of congestion in the network and thus increases an individual node's life, the entire network lifetime, and reduces partitioning in the network.",

In order to address such requirements and related challenges, Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) promote the development of more intelligent, adaptable and responsiveness supervisory and control systems capable to overcome the inherent complexity and dynamics of industrial environments. In this context, this work presents an agent-based industrial CPS, where agents are endowed with data analysis capabilities for distributed, collaborative and adaptive process supervision and control. Additionally, to address the different industrial levels' requirements, this work combines two main data analysis scopes: at operational level, applying distributed data stream analysis for rapid response monitoring and control, and at supervisory level, applying big data analysis for decision-making, planning and optimization.

abstract="Modern cyber-physical systems are designed to execute safety-critical applications with different criticality levels on the same platform. Security is an emerging topic in this domain and gains more and more importance since security vulnerabilities in the systems are accompanied by the risk of malicious attacks. Targeting these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to manipulate the system which results in a decrease of dependability and safety. Therefore, security mechanisms are required to ensure an adequate protection against malicious attacks. The European FP7 project DREAMS introduces a service-based architecture to implement mixed-criticality systems on networked multi-core chips. The architecture is a cross-domain architecture and is based on core services for communication, execution, time synchronization and resource management. The security services extends these core services to provide secure communication, time synchronization and resource management for the architecture. This paper defines the required security properties to harden the DREAMS architecture against malicious attacks. The security properties are mapped to concrete security services that serve as basis for the implementation of the architecture. These services are categorized into different security levels and applied to the core services of the DREAMS architecture.",

The adoption of generic data formats such as XML or JSON eases the exchange of information and interoperability among heterogeneous systems. However, the verbosity of those generic data formats usually requires system resources that might not be available in resource-constrained systems, e.g., embedded systems and those devices which are being integrated into the so-called IoT. In this work we present a method to reduce the cost of managing data models like XML or JSON by using templates and context based compression. We also provide a brief evaluation and comparison as a benchmark with current implementations of W3C's Efficient XML Interchange (EXI) processor. Although the method described in this paper is still at its initial stage, it outperforms the EXI implementations in terms of memory usage and speed, while keeping similar compression rates. As a consequence, we believe that our approach fits better for constrained systems.",

abstract="We present the first implementation of a decentralised and self-tallying internet voting protocol with maximum voter privacy using the Blockchain. The Open Vote Network is suitable for boardroom elections and is written as a smart contract for Ethereum. Unlike previously proposed Blockchain e-voting protocols, this is the first implementation that does not rely on any trusted authority to compute the tally or to protect the voter's privacy. Instead, the Open Vote Network is a self-tallying protocol, and each voter is in control of the privacy of their own vote such that it can only be breached by a full collusion involving all other voters. The execution of the protocol is enforced using the consensus mechanism that also secures the Ethereum blockchain. We tested the implementation on Ethereum's official test network to demonstrate its feasibility. Also, we provide a financial and computational breakdown of its execution cost.",

abstract="Orchestration is a well known topic in old web services literature. Anyway, what Orchestration means for Cloud services is not yet Clear. Services, especially at lower layers of Cloud Architecture, are complex: Scientific literature has focused on the problem of dealing with proper, efficient and even optimal allocation of Resources when deploying and delivering Cloud services. Hence, management of Resources is what is commonly addressed as Orchestration in the Cloud. Anyway, the increasing complexity of Cloud Architecture and the introduction of new paradigms like Internet of Things, introduced the problem of creating Value Added Services by composition, not only of Resources, but of Services too. In this work we describe an architectural solution for Orchestration at all Cloud Layers. The framework we propose (Orchestrator for Complex Services: OrCS) manages composition of services and resources in order to create composite service based on Cloud Design Patterns. It is based on a Workflow language for description of composition and it enables verification of composite services by means of Model Driven Engineering techniques, providing a precious and easy-to-use tool for Cloud Engineering.",

However, nowadays more and more systems of such kind rely on a seamless interaction of software agents with humans. Humans work in partnership (directly or indirectly) or closely related with agents that are able to act autonomously and intelligently. Specifically, humans and agents have the ability to establish a series of relationships/collaborative interactions with each other, forming what might be called human-agent teams to meet their individual or collective goals within an organisation or social structure. Systems in which people and agents operate on a large scale offer an enormous potential but also require the consideration of additional issues. In this paper we analyse the open issues that may be addressed for researches in order to develop open human-agent systems.

abstract="Wireless sensor networks consist of a large number of heterogeneous devices that communicate to collaboratively perform various tasks for users. Heterogeneous devices are deployed to sense the context of the environment. The context information is use to actuate various devices or services to support various activities of a user in a smart environment. Therefore, data correction is vital in managing issues arising from missing or corrupt contextual data due to system internal and external influences. We would like to investigate the machine learning techniques to ensure a complete and accurate sensor dataset for smart environment applications by runtime correcting missing or corrupt data due to sensor failures. We proposed a framework to correct dynamically sensory data. Specifically, we deal with the problems of faulty data (outliers, spikes, stuck-at, and noise), and missing information. Our proposed framework is able to learn temporal correlations in collected data from smart objects using Artificial Neural Network algorithm. We utilize the learned correlations to discover faulty data patterns to recover them, and imitate missing information. We implement the proposed data correction framework and test it on two real-world datasets collected from transportation domain (parking system, and road traffic).",

In this paper, authors have addressed the reader to reader collision using modified similar frame slotted ALOHA technique, called Dynamic Demand-oriented Frame Slotted ALOHA (DDFSA) based on a deterministic approach to avoid the collision. The readers form discrete adhoc network autonomously and resources are distributed using the super frame. The frame size can dynamically change according to number of adjoining readers in the network. Readers can play a role of master, backup, participating or hanging node in the network. At the start of super frame resources are allocated. The redundant reader is eliminated using reader capability. The master disseminates the frame plan and resources. This improves the network throughput by reducing number of readers and utilizing all the times slots. The simulation tests results, using omnetpp+Â software, show that resources are utilized up to 98Â {\%} with system efficiency at 99Â {\%} and nil unused time slots.",

abstract="The Economic development of the country also depends on its IT enabled services available to common citizens. The cost effective services, delivery mode and delivery time make the governance friendly to the citizens. But the conflicting and lengthy house's address system in India causes a lot of delays in services delivery. A house or building address can be used for various purposes like postal services, courier services, logistics services delivery, meetings, party venue etc. A high degree of failed service deliveries provide a gap to digitize the house address system to deliver accurate and faster services to the citizens. The paper proposes a conceptual method to digitize the house address system which may be stored electronically into a centralized database to reduce the time consuming process of writing and storing a lengthy address repeatedly for delivering the various services. The paper also explores the possibilities of how this digitized address could be integrated with the aadhaar database system to make it more potentially applied in terms of citizens' oriented applications and services. The digitized address would contribute significantly to transform India into a digitally empowered society and knowledge economy.",

abstract="Achieving an enhanced network lifetime is still an open issue in mobile ad hoc network. After years of research and invention, a robust technique to ascertain energy efficiency is yet to be explored especially to overcome an adverse effect of dynamic topology and selection of highly stabilized links during routing. Therefore, we present a very simple and cost-efficient middleware called as MEEM i.e. Middleware for Energy Efficiency in Mobile ad hoc network that offers an effective solution towards this problem. MEEM offers cost effectiveness by enabling the middleware to increase its scope of selection of stabilized routes based on formulating new multiple decision-making parameters e.g. Time for Route Termination, Time for Stable Routing, Frequency of Route Error, Reduction in Signal Attenuation, and Remnant Network Lifetime. The design of MEEM is carried out using quadratic approach thereby retaining parallel processing of an algorithm to enhance the communication performance of the mobile nodes. The outcome of the study was found to excel better results in comparison to frequently used routing protocol e.g. Adhoc On-demand Distance Vector (AODV) and Optimized Link State Routing (OLSR) with respect to energy consumption and algorithm processing time. The algorithm is found to be compliant of time and space complexity thereby results in cost effective solution.",

In this paper, situational awareness (SA) has made this crucial decision making process more efficient, by providing the valuable data about the surrounding environment. In a smart home, apart from the electrical appliances, the intelligent sensors are also consuming energy while transmitting data or when they are in idle mode. In this contribution, our focus is on implementing and analysing a situational awareness-based ad-hoc network in a home environment, in order to reduce the energy consumption, and therefore, increasing the lifetime of these networks. The presented results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed SA-centric method, and further confirm the energy consumption in the intended environment is decreased dramatically due to the applied schedule and limitations on the working hours of the devices.

abstract="In order to solve the problem of human target tracking in smart-home Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) environment, and only based on limited measurement data of Binary PIR sensors, the sensor networks joint likelihood is derived, which proposes the indoor PIR sensor network Binary Auxiliary Particle Filter (Bin-APF) fusion estimate algorithm further more. Meanwhile, as for the problem of multiple human targets measurement classification and trajectory association, combined with PIR's binary measurement, an improved K-Nearest Neighbor algorithm is adopted. And according to parameters of current experimental environment, a simulation is carried out, which contributes to the algorithm proposed. Experiment and Simulation results indicate that the MTT-KNN-Bin-APF algorithm accord well with the expectation of in-home multiple human target localization and tracking in consideration of actual result and error precision. Moreover, the algorithm is in low dependency of sensor network's layout, which is suitable for various type of household arrangement. The method provides a solution to indoor human target tracking and is promising in the field of smart home.",

To this end, this paper will discuss two important issues in detail: community-based creation of interaction plugins and runtime deployment of interaction plugins. The paper also features a mobilebased implementation of this approach based on the Dynamix context framework.",

For this purpose, we define safety-centric contexts based on risk description that is provided by the safety management system. This paper presents a risk-adaptive access control model that adopts hierarchies of contexts and security domains to make adaptations to risks at different levels of criticality. Since various risks may arise simultaneously, two or more security domains might be applicable at the same time incorporating various security rules which might lead to conflicts. Therefore, an approach to analyze conflicts is essential. In this work, we propose a conflict analysis algorithm based on set theory and we illustrate its usage with the proposed risk-adaptive access control model.",

However, harvesting high-quality data from the dense network of sensors embedded in the urban infrastructure, and combining this data with social network data, poses many challenges. In this paper, we investigate the use of an intelligent middleware -- Device Nimbus -- to support data capture and analysis techniques to inform urban planning and design. We report results from a `Living Campus' experiment at the University of Melbourne, Australia focused on a public learning space case study. Local perspectives, collected via crowd sourcing, are combined with distributed and heterogeneous environmental sensor data.

The design exploration reported is part of a larger series of investigations looking into the broader question of integrating measures for preventive self-care with existing everyday activities (e.g. daily motorcycle commute) by means of digital technology. We are guided by the concept of embodied self-monitoring grounded in theories on the embodied and circumstantial nature of human actions, a construct previously used to guide design oriented research in the domain of out-of-clinic physical rehabilitation. We follow a research-through-design approach with the sketching of user experience as our primary mode of inquiry, as we look to expand opportunities for interaction design in the domain of preventive self-care. We report on the outcome of in-situ enactments performed by four motorbike riders as co-explorers engaging with our interactive soft{\&}hardware sketches while actually riding in traffic. In-situ enactments and follow-up interviews with the riders encourage us to (a) further elaborate our interactive sketches for motorbike commuting, and (b) investigate more broadly the design of digital technology in support of preventive self-care as an integrated part of mundane activities such as, in the case at hand, the daily motorcycle commute.",

abstract="In Maintenance, a vital activity in industry, ineffective Situation Awareness (SAW) is responsible for 13-17{\%} of accidents. Therefore, a successful SAW has the potential of leveraging safety and efficiency, especially in field work. Bibliographic revision shows that the main gap to develop this idea is the conflict between the structure of Maintenance (procedural) and that of SAW (dynamic). Using a holistic study to elaborate a conclusive definition of SAW in the field, our work was able to solve this dichotomy of structures by developing a conceptual framework which maintains the task-oriented nature of field operation while clustering SAW inputs into entities to outline their potential effects. This Conceptual Framework of Situation Awareness in Maintenance (CFSAM) acknowledges the link between SAW and UIs, and creates a definitive list of multiple factors/entities that supports responsiveness and improves reliability and resilience. The seven entities identified are: task, equipment, system, environment, team, enterprise and personal. To each of these entities, CFSAM assigns a role in the UI design, and analyses challenges and solutions. This new approach of considering SAW-oriented design is a multidisciplinary effort and so far the results are promising: it facilitates an efficient design of SAW in maintenance field work, increases the focus on safety and efficiency and leverages the potential of developing a coherent system with high level of adherence.",

abstract="We present a flexibly configurable toolkit for the automatic pseudonymization of datasets that keeps certain utility. The toolkit could be used to pseudonymize data in order to preserve the privacy of data owners while data processing and to meet the requirements of the new European general data protection regulation. We define some possible utility requirements and corresponding utility options a pseudonym can meet. Based on that, we define a policy language that can be used to produce machine-readable utility policies. The utility policies are used to configure the toolkit to produce a pseudonymized dataset that offers the utility options. Here, we follow a confidentiality-by-default principle. I.e., only the data mentioned in the policy is transformed and included in the pseudonymized dataset. All remaining data is kept confidential. This stays in contrast to common pseudonymization techniques that replace only personal or sensitive data of a dataset with pseudonyms, while keeping any other information in plaintext. If applied appropriately, our approach allows for providing pseudonymized datasets that includes less information that can be misused to infer personal information about the individuals the data belong to.",

abstract="Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) have been recently used for various applications. Due to the distributed and (often) unattended nature of the nodes after deployment, the lack of energy and the interruptive process in each sensor are the two major problems of WSN systems. Hence, designing a protocol which not only improves system performance but also lowers sensors' energy consumption so as to maximize the network lifetime is very much desirable. The network lifetime maximization problem was known to be NP-Hard. This paper addresses the Minimum Energy-Multicasting (MEM) problem in Duty-Cycle Wireless Sensor Networks (DC-WSNs) in which sensors cyclically switch between on/off (wake/sleep) modes. To that end, we propose a local search algorithm and compare its performance with the best algorithm so far called GS-MEM over the four datasets designated for the MEM problem.

abstract="The landscape of higher education is changing, with more techno-savvy students entering these institutions. The aim of this paper is to identify the trends of the Gartner Hype Cycles for Emerging Technologies for 2013 and 2016 and to compare the rate of adoption by higher education institutions worldwide. The research approach is a quantitative meta-analysis. Results indicate that higher education institutions are slow to adopt emerging technologies and rather adopt technologies once they have become common in the everyday lives of people. A possible solution is to find innovative and cheaper ways of incorporating the emerging trends in higher education.",

The system provides a more interactive visiting experience based on a proximity interaction with the artefacts in an exhibition, which allows an easy access to a new level of cultural information proposed by the exhibition curators. For this reason, the system also offers a set of tools for the curators with the aim of simplifying the organization and updating of the cultural content information. Finally, the system, by integrating modern technologies with the real works of art in the exhibition, proposes a possible solution to the emerging problem of the management and dissemination of cultural heritage digitalized content, leading to an improvement in the experiences of both visitors and curators.",

abstract="There is a constant challenge to incorporate new systems and upgrade existing systems under threats, constrained budget and uncertainty into systems of systems (SoS). It is necessary for program managers to be able to assess the impacts of future technology and stakeholder changes. This research helps analyze sequential decisions in an evolving SoS architecture through three key features: SoS architecture generation, assessment and implementation through negotiation. Architectures are generated using evolutionary algorithms and assessed using type II fuzzy nets. The approach accommodates diverse stakeholder views, converting them to key performance parameters (KPPs) for architecture assessment. It is not possible to implement an acknowledged SoS architecture without persuading the systems to participate. A negotiation model is proposed to help the SoS manger adapt his strategy based on system owners' behavior. Viewpoints of multiple stakeholders are aggregated to assess the overall mission effectiveness of an architecture against the overarching objectives. A search and rescue (SAR) example illustrates application of the method. Future research might include group decision making for evaluating architectures.",

abstract="Traditional user research methods, while vital to understanding software application users, can be slow to implement and learn from. Even after results are analyzed, behavioral intention, not actual user behavior, tends to be better understood. To complement this approach, big data and behavioral analytics can be used to quickly learn more about actual user behavior, thus converging data with design. This is important within fast-paced agile and continuous delivery environments. At Rapid7, an IT and analytics information security organization, the convergence of data with design has allowed for insights that have informed design decisions, which have met users' mental models and actual needs. To that end, the software design industry is starting to diverge from the form-follows-function school of design, whereby the conventional approach of the user informing the designer has been reversed.",

Capacitive measurement techniques are used in touch-screens, in the automobile industry, and for presence and activity recognition in Ubiquitous Computing. However, a drawback of the capacitive technology is the energy consumption, which is an important aspect for mobile devices. In this paper we explore possible applications of electric field sensing, a purely passive capacitive measurement technique, which can be implemented with an extremely low power consumption. To cover a wide range of applications, we examine five possible use cases in more detail. The results show that the application is feasible both in interior spaces and outdoors. Moreover, due to the low energy consumption, mobile usage is also possible.",

However, these countries are in the beginning of industrialization with many new mega projects and infrastructure expansions that demands SE professionals. This motivates the need to introduce SE education in the region. Systems engineering education demands the development of SE curriculum, which will be multidisciplinary and considers social and psychological factors by taking into account the active participation of the community. Towards this end, the paper demonstrates the necessity of SE education via designing and managing ongoing mega projects. It also proposes SE curriculum by incorporating courses covering both foundations of SE and the practice of SE.

abstract="In railways, if all the systems work synchronously and accurately then only security can be ensured. To avoid manual errors, we are hereby proposing a machine-to-machine communication network which will connect all critical machinery and subsystems. It will be a data aggregation and decision-making system during the railway operations. Whole critical machinery will be having their local error detection and correction mechanisms through sensors and transducers. They also have the proposed communication capability with the sink. All threats will be collected at a common node outside the train at a global sink which forwards the train required information for next 10-km propagation. A risk score is calculated which when higher than threshold then the train is signaled to stop immediately. All the threats have their priority score. Collected threats' priority score is added to get final risk score. This is first ever implementation of machine-to-machine network for railway security. The implementation of work is done using MATLAB v14 which is used to simulate the proposed algorithm. The simulation results are compared with the previous approaches on the basis of average transmission time. Priority score-based analysis also is done in the simulation.",

Time constraint event (TCE) and non-time constraint (NTCE) event are two broad categories in heterogeneous WSNs. To address the QoS parameters in TCE and nTCE type of applications are crucial job in resource constraint multi-event WSNs. The queue scheduler performs those set of actions which are necessary to achieve the desired QoS parameters for each distinct event separately in a sensor network. A study mainly focuses on priority-based reliability with considering their different levels of priority of traffic. Decisions are taken at various intermediate nodes by managing queue. For each level of priority a separate queue is maintained. Queue management is the heart of proposed priority architecture for achieving quality of services. Due to proper queuing operation, scheduler takes the right decision at right time to attain the required reliability. Scheduler accomplishes desired goals of every application by handling their priority and deadlines.",

abstract="A desirable characteristic of modern parallel applications is the ability to dynamically select the amount of resources to be used to meet requirements on performance or power consumption. In many cases, providing explicit guarantees on performance is of paramount importance. In streaming applications, this is related with the concept of elasticity, i.e. being able to allocate the proper amount of resources to match the current demand as closely as possible. Similarly, in other scenarios, it may be useful to limit the maximum power consumption of an application to do not exceed the power budget. In this paper we propose Nornir, a customizable C++ framework for autonomic and power-aware parallel applications on shared memory multicore machines. Nornir can be used by autonomic strategy designers to implement new algorithms and by application users to enforce requirements on applications.",

abstract="Urban mobility is a challenge in cities undergoing growing urbanisation, requiring a shift in behaviour towards more sustainable means of transportation. To investigate how technology can mediate the process of behaviour change, particularly in the context of smart cities, this paper presents a systematic literature review. Three areas are of interest: the utilised technology, behaviour change strategies, and citizen participation in the development process. A total of 14 different applications were included in the final review. The findings show that mobile devices are being prevalently used, persuasive strategies are foremost mentioned, and end-user involvement is happening late in the development process, serving primarily testing purposes. This points out that there are still various unexplored possibilities. It is suggested that future research should explore opportunities stemming from ubiquitous technology, employ behaviour change strategies grounded in reflective learning, and promote citizen involvement with participatory methods.",

The new algorithm involves some new problem specific evolutionary operations. The simulation results using the V-REP platform involve obstacles,  different surfaces and dangerous areas. The results are very encouraging, much better than those obtained using the traditional meta-heuristics, notably the widely used genetic algorithm.

abstract="In the last few years, the field of lightweight cryptography has seen an influx in the number of block ciphers and hash functions being proposed. One of the metrics that define a good lightweight design is the energy consumed per unit operation of the algorithm. For block ciphers, this operation is the encryption of one plaintext. By studying the energy consumption model of a CMOS gate, we arrive at the conclusion that the energy consumed per cycle during the encryption operation of an r-round unrolled architecture of any block cipher is a quadratic function in r. We then apply our model to 9 well known lightweight block ciphers, and thereby try to predict the optimal value of r at which an r-round unrolled architecture for a cipher is likely to be most energy efficient. We also try to relate our results to some physical design parameters like the signal delay across a round and algorithmic parameters like the number of rounds taken to achieve full diffusion of a difference in the plaintext/key.",

abstract="In product-oriented Industrial Product Service Systems (IPSSs) the customers benefit from the combination of a product which offers some functionalities and a set of services. IPSS supports the provision of services which can be offered by the product manufacturer. The services can offer a wide range of functionalities that can range from ensuring the product's original functionality to augmenting the original functionality of the product. The shifting of a company to IPSS poses many challenges such as the changing of the company's business model. One of the most important challenges for the establishment of IPSS is the appropriate planning of the resources for production, deployment, and installation into the customers' site. However, companies that provide IPSS solutions are lacking the proper tools for resources' planning in a dynamic environment. In this work, a multi-criteria resource planning method and tool for optimizing the production, delivery, and installation of IPSS is presented. The proposed solution generates alternative IPSS's production and installation plans and evaluates them on performance measures for production and installation such as time and cost. Moreover, through the integration of the planning tool with the IPSS design phase, information for generating the Bill of Process and Materials is presented. The planning tool has been designed using the Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) approach and has been applied and validated in a pilot case from the laser cutting industry.",

abstract="The goal of privacy by design (PbD) is to consider privacy aspects during all steps of a software and system design process in order to foster the development of privacy friendly technology. Current PbD approaches mainly focus on technological aspects of privacy in software engineering and rarely include viable approaches that take into account the context in which software systems are built and used. The future context of use however plays a crucial role for the effectiveness of privacy and security measures. Therefore, we propose to use a socio-technical design approach based on the established method of STWT (socio-technical walkthrough). This method allows multiple stakeholders to reflect on process models they design collaboratively over multiple sessions. Based on a privacy focused analysis of models from previous workshops we adapt the STWT and corresponding modeling guidelines to incorporate aspects relevant for privacy by design.",

abstract="Due to the demand for low-cost cryptosystems from industry, there spring up a lot of lightweight block ciphers which are excellent for some different implementation features. An innovative design is the block cipher PRINCE. To meet the requirement for low-latency and instantaneously encryption, NXP Semiconductors and its academic partners cooperate and design the low-latency block cipher PRINCE. Another good example is the block cipher LED which is very compact in hardware, and whose designers also aim to maintain a reasonable software performance. In this paper, we demonstrate how to achieve high software performance of these two ciphers on the AVR 8-bit microcontrollers using bitslice technique. Our bitsliced implementations speed up the execution of these two ciphers several times with less memory usage than previous work. In addition to these two nibble-oriented ciphers, we also evaluate the software performance of a newly proposed lightweight block cipher RECTANGLE, whose design takes bitslicing into consider. Our results show that RECTANGLE has very high ranks among the existing block ciphers on 8-bit microcontrollers in the real-world usage scenarios.",

abstract="Large amounts of data are increasingly gathered in order to support decision making processes in asset management. The challenge is how best to utilise the large amounts of fragmented and unorganised data sets to benefit decision making, also at fleet level. It is therefore important to be able to utilize and combine all the relevant data, both technical and economic, to create new business knowledge to support effective decision making especially within diverse situations. It is also important to acknowledge that different types of data are required in different decision making context. A review of the literature has shown that decision making situations are usually categorized according to the decision making levels, namely strategic, tactical and operational. In addition, they can be classified according to the amount of time used in decision making. For example, two situations can be compared: (1) optimization decision where a large amount of time and consideration is used to determine an optimum solution, and (2) decisions that need to be made instantly. Fleet management of industrial assets suffers from a lack of asset management strategies in order to ensure the correct data is collected, analysed and used to inform critical business decisions with regard to fleet management. In this paper we categorize the decision making process within certain situation and propose a new framework to identify fleet decision making situations.",

However, their use must be controlled and human perception should be considered to avoid information overload. In this paper, we present a dynamic mechanism to coordinate the distribution of notification across smart devices. This personalized notification mechanism uses an inference engine and a set of rules to generate notification alternatives and select the ``best'' one. A continuous refinement approach is also used to improve notification delivery. Our system was evaluated and the baseline rules were established by 11 expert users. The main results show that in some scenarios, the notification mechanism selection converged quickly and results are promising.

However, well-designed service composition approaches always lacks the consideration of execution environment, and the approach designed for application execution is usually incomplete and lacking necessary business consideration. In order to improve the comprehensiveness covered both design and execution stages, a service composition approach based on process mining is proposed. First, a meta-model is designed to connect the information of execution environment and business requirement. Next, the scene model based on this meta-model is generated by leveraging process mining. Then the scene model is applied to do service composition, including service selection from the Service Registry. After that, BPEL instance is converted based on aggregated scene information so as to enable application execution. Finally, a cloud-based logistics platform is implemented to verify the approach, and the result shows that the approach has high requirement accuracy and execution effectiveness.",

In this paper, we propose a light weight data encryption method, named the Light Encryption for WSN Data communication (LED for short), for a wireless sensor network. The LED provides a secure environment for sensors to encrypt data with a simple, secure, and low-computation method before the data are transmitted to the sink node via a wireless network.

abstract="This work presents an Ambient Intelligence system that targets energy consumption awareness and savings. The system was deployed at the School of Science and Technology of the International Hellenic University and follows a three-layer approach. The first layer hosts devices (currently smart plugs, sensor boards and smart clampers) suited for the purpose. The second layer, namely the aWESoME middleware (a WEb Service MiddlewarE), resolves interoperability issues on the first layer, by universally exposing all actuator functions and sensor data through Web Services. Finally, a prototype application, named iDEALISM, has been developed to reside on the topmost layer. iDEALISM presents and manages all heterogeneous devices in the same place, enabling users to make comparisons, and take informed decisions on saving energy.",

abstract="The concept of partial commitment is discussed in the context of personal privacy management in data science. Uncommitted, promiscuous or partially committed user's data may either have a negative impact on model or data quality, or it may impose higher privacy compliance cost on data service providers. Many Big Data (BD) and Machine Learning (ML) scenarios involve the collection and processing of large volumes of person-related data. Data is gathered about many individuals as well as about many parameters in individuals. ML and BD both spend considerable resources on model building, learning, and data handling. It is therefore important to any BD/ML system that the input data trained and processed is of high quality, represents the use case, and is legally processes in the system. Additional cost is imposed by data protection regulation with transparency, revocation and correction rights for data subjects. Data subjects may, for several reasons, only partially accept a privacy policy, and chose to opt out, request data deletion or revoke their consent for data processing. This article discusses the concept of partial commitment and its possible applications from both the data subject and the data controller perspective in Big Data and Machine Learning.",

Necessary programming concepts are learned on the way (``diving into programming'').

abstract="Abundant experiments have shown that phantom source nodes cannot leave far away from the real source node. In this paper, we propose a novel position tracking based source location privacy (PTSLP) protection scheme for wireless sensor networks (WSNs). First, we construct a phantom area in order to make phantom source nodes being far from the real source node. Secondly, we combine shortest path routing and random routing to forward packets to sink node rather than deviating from sink node. Then, we make every packet pass through a special area called trace cost area which consists of many sensor nodes with different weights in different areas and finally reach the ring around sink node. Compared with SLP-E, which fails to take overlapping path into consideration, our proposed scheme can reduce overlapping path. Simulation results show that PTSLP can increase safety time and enhance source location privacy in WSNs.",

abstract="This keynote paper addresses existing problems with traditional non-machine readable contracts that are based on trust. Such contracts have mostly a ceremonial purpose between transacting business parties and when conflicts occur, traditional contracts are often not enforcible. On the other hand, so called smart contracts that are machine readable and supported by blockchain-technology transactionalities, do not require qualitative trust between contracting parties as blockchain establish instead a quantitative notion of trust. However, currently existing smart-contract solutions that equip the protocol layer on top of blockchains with Turing-complete programming languages, lead to the false claim by industry practitioners they can manage smart contracts successfully. Instead, it is important to start considering the currently missing application layer for smart contracts.",

abstract="Ensuring resilience of multi-robotic systems is a notoriously difficult task. Decentralised architectures and asynchronous communication require powerful modelling techniques to demonstrate system resilience. In this paper, resilience of a multi-robotic system is defined as the ability to achieve goals despite robot failures. We demonstrate how to rigorously specify and verify essential properties of resilience mechanisms of multi-robotic systems by refinement in Event-B. To assess the desired resilience characteristics, we augment our formal models with statistical data and rely on probabilistic verification. The automated support provided by the PRISM model checker allows us to calculate the probability of goal reachability in the presence of robot failures and compare different reconfiguration strategies for selected architectures. We demonstrate our approach by a case study -- development and assessment of a cleaning multi-robotic system.",

abstract="Wireless sensor networks (WSN) emerge at the center of the fast expanding Internet of Things (IoT) revolution, and hence increased research efforts are being directed towards its efficient deployment, optimization and adaptive operation. Rapid deployment of WSN in an unknown open environment is a critical challenge that involves finding optimal locations for the network nodes to deliver optimally balanced sensing and communication services at the maximum possible coverage subject to complex mutual constraints. We address this challenge with a variant of the Voronoi-based algorithm that leverages the converged movement towards Voronoi cells' centers with the intelligent nodes' provisioning algorithm to deliver fully automated and autonomous WSN that rapidly self-deploys itself to any finite indoor environment without using any prior knowledge of the size and structure of the target space. Sequential provisioning supports realistic implementation that accounts for collision avoidance and mitigates the risk of wasteful over-deployment. The preliminary comparative simulation results carried out in a simplified environment indicate very fast convergence to the well balanced WSN at the fairly small deployment cost and thereby validate our model as a very promising compared to the previous approaches to WSN deployment.",

pages="280--298",
abstract="RDF stream processing (RSP) has become a vibrant area of research in the semantic web community. Recent advances have resulted in the development of several RSP engines that leverage semantics to facilitate reasoning over flows of incoming data. These engines vary greatly in terms of implemented query syntax, their evaluation and operational semantics, and in various performance dimensions. Existing benchmarks tackle particular aspects such as functional coverage, result correctness, or performance. None of them, however, assess RSP engine behavior comprehensively with respect to all these dimensions. In this paper, we introduce YABench, a novel benchmarking framework for RSP engines. YABench extends the concept of correctness checking and provides a flexible and comprehensive tool set to analyze and evaluate RSP engine behavior. It is highly configurable and provides quantifiable and reproducible results on correctness and performance characteristics. To validate our approach, we replicate results of the existing CSRBench benchmark with YABench. We then assess two well-established RSP engines, CQELS and C-SPARQL, through more comprehensive experiments. In particular, we measure precision, recall, performance, and scalability characteristics while varying throughput and query complexity. Finally, we discuss implications on the development of future stream processing engines and benchmarks.",

abstract="Big graph model is frequently used to represent large-scale datasets such as geographical and healthcare data. Deploying these datasets in a third-party public cloud is a common solution for data sharing and processing. Maintaining data security in a public cloud is crucial. Here we target the data integrity issue, which is mainly achieved by hash operations. Existing hash schemes for graphs-structured data are either not suitable to all type of graphs or not computationally efficient for big graph. In this paper, we propose a secure, scalable hash scheme that is applicable to big graphs/trees, and its computation is highly efficient. We use the graph structure information to make our scheme unforgeable. Furthermore, we skillfully tune the scheme to make the graph verification and update processes very efficient. We will prove that our hash scheme is cryptographically secure. Our experimental results show that it has scalable computation performance.",

abstract="The wide availability of high interconnection networks, powerful mobile devices and service-oriented architectures has paved the way for the delivery of cloud services. Moving information technology services to the cloud has imposed new ways of interaction with users.

Transferring the rich user interface of the desktop, where running the software dynamically online and instantly following up with social networking activities is relatively easy, to the web-browser on mobile devices is introducing many challenges. This has resulted in the emergence of innovative cloud services and implementation approaches specifically to handle the new user interface demands.

abstract="Authentication is one of the most important technologies to protect the privacy and security of RFID systems. The EPCglobal Class-1 Gen-2 specification is an important standard for RFID. The tags conforming to this standard have limited computing and store resources, and no more attentions are paid to their security and privacy. So the application of these tags is not secure. But this kind of tags is considered as the main stream for RFID applications. In order to solve the secure problems for this kind of RFID tags we propose a lightweight authentication protocol based on CRC, which can assure forward security and prevent information leakage, location tracing, eavesdropping, DOS attack, replay attack, and spoofing. This protocol avoids CRC collision by reasonably dividing the tag's identification information into two different parts and it enhances the mutual authentication strength between tags and readers by dual authentications. This protocol only uses the computing resources embedded in tags and it is very suitable to low-cost RFID systems.",

There are currently specialized systems to detect gait events and compute spatio-temporal parameters of human gait, which are accurate and redundant. These systems are expensive and are limited to controlled settings with gait evaluations widely spaced in terms of time. As alternative, a proposal for long-term gait monitoring in Assisted Living Environments based on an infrastructure of wireless inertial sensors is presented. Specifically, heel-strike events will be identified in multiple elders in a rest home and throughout the day. A small wearable device composed of a single inertial measurement unit will be placed at the back of each elder, on the thoracic zone, capturing trunk accelerations and orientations which will enable the demarcation of heel-strike events and the computation of temporal gait parameters. This proposal attempts to contribute to the development of a less intrusive and reachable alternative for long-term gait monitoring of multiple residents, which has been poorly investigated.",

abstract="Fuzz testing is an established technique in order to find zero-day-vulnerabilities by stimulating a system under test with invalid or unexpected input data. However, fuzzing techniques still generate far more test cases than can be executed. Therefore, different kinds of risk-based testing approaches are used for test case identification, selection and prioritization. In contrast to many approaches that require manual risk analysis, such as fault tree analysis, failure mode and effect analysis, and the CORAS method, we propose an automated approach that takes advantage of an already shown correlation between interface complexity and error proneness. Since fuzzing is a negative testing approach, we propose a complexity metric for the negative input space that measures the boundaries of the negative input space of primitive types and complex data types. Based on this metric, the assumed most error prone interfaces are selected and used as a starting point for fuzz test case generation. This paper presents work in progress.",

abstract="Activity recognition aims at modeling the occupants' behavior by analyzing the sensor data collected from the smart environment. Though most of the activity recognition systems use supervised learning techniques for building such models there is a shift towards the unsupervised learning paradigm as the process of annotating and labeling the data is prone to errors. This paper proposes an Event Pattern Activity Modeling Framework (EPAM) to identify the occupant activity pattern from the sensor data by using an unsupervised machine learning approach and further analysis is done with a knowledge driven approach. In the context of smart environments, an activity is considered as a sequence of events that are generated continuously from the sensor data. The segmentation algorithm proposed in EPAM is used to identify appropriate event patterns for an activity that are then grouped together using a pattern clustering algorithm that presents a hierarchy of activities. The set of activities of the occupant, observed in a smart environment is not always sequential but is highly interleaved and discontinuous. The proposed algorithm accommodates this valid factor by an innovative use of the Jaro Winkler similarity measure. The hierarchy of activity generated by the pattern clustering approach is used for activity modeling. Ontology based activity modeling is preferred over other modeling techniques because of its unified modeling, representation and semantically clear reasoning. The experimental results show that the proposed EPAM framework of segmentation, pattern clustering and ontological modeling is efficient and more effective than the existing approach of activity modeling.",

abstract="We present a dynamic Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) protocol for predictable communication in Networked Embedded Systems. The nodes in such systems are typically resource constrained and can communicate over low power, low bandwidth wireless links. Several TDMA protocols have been reported in the literature for similar nodes. The approach we present offers dynamic reconfiguration of the flows between nodes in the system. Our protocol uses dynamic time slots that will be assigned online to the nodes as needed. In our current architecture, a centralized coordinator directs the flow among the nodes by reconfiguring the local TDMA schedules. In the future, this protocol can be extended to fully enable reconfigurable flows in Networked Embedded Systems using a collection of decentralized controllers.",

abstract="The ``sharing revolution'' would not be possible without digital technologies and the diffusion of ICT worldwide. ICT has created a new level playing field also thanks to peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms, and a new concept, the ``sharing and collaborative consumption online'', is expanding. This concept is based on what can be called CASH - ``collaboration'', ``access'', ``sharing'' rather than ``ownership'' meant also as a chance to collect money in addition to monthly salary. This paper aims to describe a successful P2P platform that well reflect the CASH concept, Airbnb, currently the leader of the online accommodation marketplace, using the case study approach and the SWOT analysis methodology. This analysis is useful in order to understand the main features and functioning of such a platform and what to expect for the years to come. Results show that Airbnb is growing at high speed in terms of users and profits but some challenges have to be faced in the next future linked to regulatory issues and to traditional accommodation market and citizens reactions.",

However, by the impact of many factors, failure rate of big data project is higher than the IT project. In order to reduce the risk of failure, big data projects must overcome a serial of challenges. Ambiguous requirements, poor data quality, and lacking changeability and extensity will directly affect the results of big data analytics, and even cause the wrong decision, inaccurate prediction and improper planning. Making the big data projects have potential failure risk. For this, this paper applies iterative and incremental development (IID) into the data preprocessing, draws up the iterative and incremental data quality improvement (IIDQI) procedure.

abstract="The large scale deployment of ambient assisted living systems raises challenges related to the heterogeneity of the environments in which sensors, devices and services will be deployed, as well as the diversity of patients' needs and profiles. In these environments, each patient has a specific profile that influences the choice of interaction devices and requires particular services. The selection of required context-aware services affects the decision on the set of sensors that need to be installed. Moreover, even in one specific environment, new sensors, devices and services may need to be added due to the evolution of patient's needs. Therefore, a generic framework that is able to adapt to such dynamic environments and to integrate new sensors, devices and services at runtime is required. In this paper, we present a dynamic framework for ambient assisted living able to adapt to the non-uniformity of the deployment environments. The main contribution consists of a semantically driven plug{\&}play mechanism integrated seamlessly with the reasoning engine so that all the entities present in the environment can be plugged and integrated in the reasoning process without interrupting the framework functionality. Our solution is based on the OSGi framework with the use of the DPWS standard and the semantic web.",

The failure occurs due to the varying levels of the loads and external parameters that defines context. This paper demonstrates the ontology contextual modeling for the diagnosis of rollers as a context by using dynamic response. The roller is modeled using physical models and applying runs of different parameters and its levels. Then contextual models are generated for rollers to show relation among input contextual parameters with different features.

An efficient common management between different clouds is essential benefit, like boundless elasticity and scalability. Yet, issues related with different standards led to interoperability problems. For this reason, the definition of the open cloud-computing interface defines a set of open community-lead specifications along with a flexible API to build cloud systems. Today, there are cloud systems like OpenStack, OpenNebula, Amazon Web Services and VMWare VCloud that expose APIs for inter-cloud communication. In this work we aim to explore an inter-cloud model by creating a new cloud platform service to act as a mediator among OpenStack, FI-WARE datacenter resource management and Amazon Web Service cloud architectures, therefore to orchestrate communication of various cloud environments. The model is based on the FI-WARE and will be offered as a reusable enabler with an open specification to allow interoperable service coordination.",

abstract="Electronic communities of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAO) that engage in agile business-network collaborations, are enabled by recent blockchain-technology related innovations using smart contracting. DAOs utilize service-oriented cloud computing in a loosely-coupled collaboration lifecycle that commences with the setup phase. The latter supports the selection of services provided and used by DAOs in combination with smart contract negotiations. Such setup phases for DAO-communities use blueprints of business-network models that DAOs populate with tentative service offers. The negotiation phase may result either in a consensual agreement, a counteroffer, or a disagreement. In the latter case, the smart contract negotiation collapses and the lifecycle returns to the beginning of the selected collaboration blueprints. To the best of our knowledge, such a smart-contracting setup lifecycle has not been formalized so far. The paper fills the gap and evaluates the model with means of model-checking methods.",

abstract="The Internet of Thing (IoT) has given rise to the integration of smart systems in the industrial, healthcare, and social environments. These smart systems are often implemented by system-on-chip (SoC) solutions that require power management units, sensors, signal processors, and wireless interfaces. Hence, an independent voltage reference circuit is crucial for obtaining accurate measurements from the sensors and for the proper operation of the SoC. Making, bandgap circuits indispensable in these types of applications. Typically, bandgap circuits are implemented using bipolar transistors to generate two voltages with opposite temperature coefficients (Complementary To Absolute Temperature -- CTAT; Proportional do Absolute Temperature - PTAT) which are added resulting in a temperature independent voltage reference. The disadvantage of using bipolar devices is that the power supply voltage must be larger than the ON base-emitter voltage, resulting in voltages larger than 0.7Â V. The low power demands of IoT and of technology scaling, have forced lower values for the power supply voltage and thus new bandgap circuits using only CMOS transistors have gathered increased interest. In these, the MOS transistors operate in the weak inversion region where its current has an exponential relation with its gate-to-source voltage, as in the bipolar devices. Making it possible to generate both the PTAT and the CTAT voltages and thus produce a temperature independent voltage reference. This paper describes a design methodology of an all CMOS bandgap voltage reference circuit, in which one of the transistors works in the moderate region and the other in the weak inversion, to achieve the lowest possible voltage variation with temperature. The circuit produces a voltage reference of 0.45Â V from a minimum power supply voltage of 0.6Â V, with a total variation of 1.54Â mV, over a temperature range of â40 to 100{\textdegree}C, resulting in a temperature coefficient of 24Â ppm/{\textdegree}C, and a power supply rejection ratio (PSRR) of â40Â dB.",

Moreover, blockchain data are highly compressed before flushing to hard disk, making it harder to have an insight of these valuable data set. In this work, we develop EtherQL, an efficient query layer for Ethereum -- the most representative open-source blockchain system. EtherQL provides highly efficient query primitives for analyzing blockchain data, including range queries and top-k queries, which can be integrated with other applications with much flexibility. Moreover, EtherQL is designed to provide different levels of abstraction, which are suitable for data analysts, researchers and application developers.",

In this paper, we study an approach to convergence for software and applications/algorithms and show what hardware architectures it suggests. We start by dividing applications into data plus model components and classifying each component (whether from Big Data or Big Compute) in the same way. This leads to 64 properties divided into 4 views, which are Problem Architecture (Macro pattern); Execution Features (Micro patterns); Data Source and Style; and finally the Processing (runtime) View. We discuss convergence software built around HPC-ABDS (High Performance Computing enhanced Apache Big Data Stack) and show how one can merge Big Data and HPC (Big Simulation) concepts into a single stack and discuss appropriate hardware.",

Since that the behaviour are not easily identified prior to the abuse, this study gathers and collect information about child sexual abuse by pedophile and propose a comprehensive decision support system to educate children base on knowledge-driven method about online grooming by molesters. An interactive system is built to provide knowledge to children regarding child sexual abuse and pedophile in terms of definition and each characteristics of it. The main purpose of the system is compiling database about child sexual abuse and pedophiles in order to determine the level of child's exposure to pedophile in term of five attributes which is selection of victims, gaining access, grooming, trust and approach.",

abstract="Structure information has been increasingly incorporated into computer vision field, whereas only a few tracking methods have employed the inner structure of the target. In this paper, we introduce a dynamic graph with pairwise Markov property to model the structure information between the inner parts of the target. The target tracking is viewed as tracking a dynamic undirected graph whose nodes are the target parts and edges are the interactions between parts. These target parts within the graph waiting for matching are separated from the background with graph cut, and a spectral matching technique is exploited to accomplish the graph tracking. With the help of an intuitive updating mechanism, our dynamic graph can robustly adapt to the variations of target structure. Experimental results demonstrate that our structured tracker outperforms several state-of-the-art trackers in occlusion and structure deformations.",

abstract="In this paper, we propose a new reflectance separation model to separate the diffuse and specular reflection components. The model is based on a two-dimensional space called Ch-CV space, which is spanned by maximum chromaticity (Ch) and the coefficient of variation (CV) of RGB color. The space exhibits a more direct correspondence to diffuse and specular reflection components than the RGB color space, as well as the HSI color space. Under the whitened illumination, the surface points with the same diffuse chromaticity have the same slope in Ch-CV space. Based on these properties, we propose a slope-based region growing method to implement an image segmentation in the specular regions, and to separate the reflection components for each segmented region. The comparison experiments with several state-of-the-art algorithms show its superior capability to separate the specular and diffuse reflection components.",

abstract="Billions of interconnected neurons are the building block of the human brain. For each brain activity these neurons produce electrical signals or brain waves that can be obtained by the Electroencephalogram (EEG) recording. Due to the characteristics of EEG signals, recorded signals often contaminate with undesired physiological signals other than the cerebral signal that is referred to as the EEG artifacts such as the ocular or the muscle artifacts. Therefore, identification and handling of artifacts in the EEG signals in a proper way is becoming an important research area. This paper presents an automated EEG artifacts handling approach, combining Wavelet transform, Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and Hierarchical clustering. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been examined and observed on real EEG recording. According to the result, the proposed approach identified artifacts in the EEG signals effectively and after handling artifacts EEG signals showed acceptable considering visual inspection.",

The mobile application is devoted to providing medical staff with the geolocation of victims as well as with an assistant indicating the best route to follow in order to take care of them based on the severity of their conditions and based on a triage method. Resolution of the routes is solved based on a classical problem, a Travelling Salesman Problem, using a k-partition algorithm to divide the huge number of victims in different clusters. Thus, each doctor has a specific area to assist victims. Besides, doctors can use a functionality of the application to contact their peers through a chat when additional help is needed.

abstract="To implement the objective of smart traffic system, it is essential to introduce the cutting-edge Information technology, and applied to the transport system. Cyber-physical system (CPS) is a highly complex system that deeply integrates the physical and computing process. Its core is the organic integration of computing, communications and control technology to achieve real-time monitoring, analysis and control of large-scale interconnected physical systems. CPS has broad application prospects. In this paper, the basic framework of the Cyber-Physical traffic System (CPTS) is proposed. The concept and relevant characteristics of the CPS are first introduced. The architecture and key technology of CPTS are then illustrated. Next, Research techniques and methods of future CPTS are discussed in details, from the aspects of system modeling, large-scale information acquisition, optimization and control. The major challenges of CPLS research are finally discussed in details. Finally the future development path of CPTS is simply analyzed.",

Simulations indicated that hiding capacity is larger than existing techniques while the perceived quality is good. Moreover, the method is tolerant of the attacks such as inversion, translation, truncation, and Gaussian noise-addition attacks, which is rare in conventional ECG steganographic schemes. Since the privacy (or medical message) of the patients can be fast and effective embedded in ECG host by the proposed method, it is feasible for our method being employed in real-time applications.",

Except the common feature of biometric recognition, its unique ``aliveness'' and individual difference of heart geometric structure, This make ECG waveform has becoming a kind of high security level biometric. The paper proposed a similarity measurement strategy to do recognition work by ECG waveform. It uses the ECG waveforms collected from one person as his or her ECG waveform sample set. These ECG waveforms were partitioned into single ECG waveform (which is generate by one heart beat) firstly. And the discrete points that formed single ECG waveforms were overlaid into a two dimension coordinate. The points which have same coordinate will be accumulated, and the color of this coordinate will be changed into a 8 bit color system according to the overlay number of point. After the procedures, it presents a hierarchy color changing image, which can be used as a tunnel like ECG morph. Moreover, the inclusive degree can be computed by color clustering status. In the end, the morph will become the morph model of the person to judge the belonging of new ECG data. The ECG data used in the paper is from MIT/BIH ECG standard data set. From the results, the recognition accurate of ECG recognition can reach to 95.1{\%} averagely.",

To easily record and remind the time of taking medication, the smart pillbox has been developed. However, currently most of smart pillboxes were designed for elderlies who usually stay in home. They are too large to be easily carried, with multiple buttons on their interfaces and complex steps of operation. This study introduces a smart pillbox system which applies magnet and tablet computer as its entity to be interface. The system uses 3D printing technology to produce prototype kit, and the magnet so that each cartridge is connected. Through installing Liang Rong-Hao's GaussSense to enhance its accuracy of sensor, the user can operate the tablet computer to obtain information wanted by moving, rotating and combing the pillbox. The study evaluates the practicality and feasibility through applying software prototyping method on implementation system, and its result will be the reference for future development and research.",

The paper highlights these developments, which include internal research programmes, European Union funded research projects and Airbus internal synergy projects to provide a complete system engineering lifecycle. This research includes an EU funded 3Â year project HoliDes---Holistic Human Factors and System Design of Adaptive Cooperative Human Machine Systems [1]. HSI has been incorporated in the project lifecycle via US Military (DoD-Instruction 5000.2) [2] with the introduction of a Human System Integration Plan, which is a key requirement for the validation and verification of any new system or any modification to any existing US military system. Airbus DS has used HSI in several innovative approaches, these include, the dramatic reduction in the manpower and costs of deployment and logistic support for large scale military operations, the integration with our Architectural Framework to provide a system architecture that is compliant with the US and UK Lines of development---Training, Equipment, Personnel (HR), Organisation, Information, Logistics, Concepts and Doctrine and Infrastructure and the introduction of ILS and Training into our MBSE approach. Airbus DS recognises the need to integrate HSI into its system engineering lifecycle as in the past the inclusion of human interaction has generally been missed and as most systems interact with people, HSI provides Airbus DS with complete systems integration process. Our Human System Integration (HSI) work at Airbus DS is evolving from the initial Human View Architectural Framework research [4] and then the nine HSI domains---Manpower, Personnel, Training, Human Factors Engineering, Environment, Occupational Health, Safety, Survivability and Habitability [5].",

It consists of a net of sensors and actuators with Zigbee communication and control software for storage and availability of monitoring data on a web portal in real time. In manual mode, the irrigation management is the responsibility of the irrigation manager in order to control the system from the portal. In automatic mode, the system prevents watering if there is a forecast of precipitation (up to 3 days) and if the humidity of the soil has not fallen below a critical value. In this mode the decision is made at the local station. The system also gives preference to irrigation at night and during periods of light wind in order to obtain more accurate and efficient irrigation.",

abstract="A big challenge for Europe is the demographic shift towards an aging population. Resources in the health care sector are limited, so it is important that the seniors of tomorrow will be able to stay healthy and manage themselves as long as possible, preferably also with a good quality of life. Physical activity is very important both for mobility and for the general well-being, but it can be hard to find motivation to exercise alone at home. Also in rehabilitation there is a need for a more engaging approach than a sheet of paper describing exercises that should be performed. In the GameUp project we developed fun and motivational exergames particularly targeting elderly in a user centred approach. Physiotherapists ensured that the movements and exercises were good for flexibility, leg strength and balance. In addition to seven Kinect games, a walking app and a professional portal were developed. The Kinect games can be played in several levels, and those who are at risk of falling are able to play while seated. The professional portal ensures that the results of the project also can be used as a tool in rehabilitation. Test results from 20 elderly aged 65-95 as well as clinical trials of adherence to the exercises are encouraging, and the international and multidisciplinary team behind the project is now looking for ways to commercialize the project outcomes.",

A real-life pilot study was conducted to evaluate the feasibility of the approach in the daily life of young adults. A clustering algorithm is used to locate people's important places and an analysis of the sensitivity of the different parameters used in the algorithm is provided.

abstract="rTiMo is a real-time version of TiMo (Timed Mobility), which is a process algebra for mobile distributed systems. In this paper, we investigate the denotational semantics for rTiMo. A trace variable tr is introduced to record the communications among processes as well as the location where the communication action takes place. Based on the formalized model, we study a set of algebraic laws, especially the laws about the migration and communication with real-time constraints. In order to facilitate the algebraic reasoning about the parallel expansion laws, we enrich rTiMo with a form of                                                                           {\$}{\$}guarded {\backslash} choice{\$}{\$}                .

abstract="An increasing number of mobile applications aim to enable ``smart cities'' by harnessing contributions from citizens armed with mobile devices that have sensing ability. However, there are few generally recognized guidelines for developing and deploying crowdsourcing-based solutions in mobile environments. This paper considers the design of a crowdsourcing-based smart parking system as a specific case study in an attempt to explore the basic design principles applicable to an array of similar applications. Through simulations, we show that the strategies behind crowdsourcing can heavily influence the utility of such applications. Equally importantly, we show that tolerating a certain level of freeriding increases the social benefits while maintaining quality of service level offered. Our findings provide designers with a better understanding of mobile crowdsourcing features and help guide successful designs.",

abstract="A Mobile Social Networks (MSN) is a kind of opportunistic network, which is composed of numerous mobile nodes with social characteristic. By now, the prevalent community-based routing algorithms mainly choose the optimal social characteristic node to forward messages, however they rarely consider the effects of community distribution on mobile nodes and time-varying characteristics of network. These algorithms usually lead to a high consumption of network resources and a low successful delivery ratio if they are used directly in mobile social networks. In order to solve this problem, we build a time-varying community-based network model, and propose a community-aware message opportunistic transmission algorithm (CMOT) in this paper. For inter-community messages transmission, the CMOT chooses an optimal community path by comparing the community transmission probability. In local communities, messages are forwarded according to the encounter probability between nodes. The simulation results show that, in comparison with classical routing algorithms, such as PRoPHET, MaxProp, Spray and Wait, and CMTS, the CMOT can improve the successful delivery ratio of messages and reduce network overheadÂ obviously.",

abstract="This paper presents an accurate indoor localisation approach to provide context aware support for Activities of Daily Living. This paper explores the use of contemporary wearable technology (Google Glass) to facilitate a unique first-person view of the occupants environment. Machine vision techniques are then employed to determine an occupant's location via environmental object detection within their field of view. Specifically, the video footage is streamed to a server where object recognition is performed using the Oriented Features from Accelerated Segment Test and Rotated Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features algorithm with a K-Nearest Neighbour matcher to match the saved keypoints of the objects to the scene. To validate the approach, an experimental set-up consisting of three ADL routines, each containing at least ten activities, ranging from drinking water to making a meal were considered. Ground truth was obtained from manually annotated video data and the approach was subsequently benchmarked against a common method of indoor localisation that employs dense sensor placement. The paper presents the results from these experiments, which highlight the feasibility of using off-the-shelf machine vision algorithms to determine indoor location based on data input from wearable video-based sensor technology. The results show a recall, precision, and F-measure of 0.82, 0.96, and 0.88 respectively. This method provides additional secondary benefits such as first person tracking within the environment and lack of required sensor interaction to determine occupant location.",

abstract="Parameterised Networks of Synchronised Automata (pNets) is a machine-oriented semantic formalism used for specifying and verifying the behaviour of distributed components or systems. In addition, it can be used to define the semantics of languages in the parallel and distributed computation area. Unlike other traditional process calculi, pNets only own one pNet node as an operator which composes all subnets running in parallel. Using this single synchronisation artifact, it is capable of expressing many operators or synchronisation mechanisms. In this paper, we explore a denotational semantics for parameterised networks. The denotational semantics of parameterised networks we investigate is based on the behaviours of their subnets. The behaviour of a subnet is determined by both its state and the actions it executes. Based on the traces of a set of subnets, the behaviour of a pNet consisting of those subnets can be deduced. A set of algebraic laws is also explored based on the denotational semantics.",

The biomass estimation model was based on the Time-Integrated Value of NDVI (TINDVI) and Leaf Water Content Index (LWCI), which was used to predict the winter wheat biomass. And the model was validated with the ground measured biomass. The results showed that the determination coefficient (R2) and root mean square error (RMSE) between the measured and the estimated biomass were 0.7949 and 2.689 t/ha, respectively. The estimated biomass was exactly similar to the field measured biomass, therefore this model had a good application prospect.",

abstract="Wireless Sensor Network in which nodes are mobile can be defined as MWSN (Mobile Wireless Sensor Networks). MWSNs are a budding field of research in contrast to their well-established ancestor. It consists of a variety of sensing elements deployed indiscriminately and at enormous scale. This can build a huge variety of redundant sensory information. Transmission of such redundant data saturates network resources and it additionally consumes nodes energy. Data aggregation is the process of reducing the amount of packets to be sent to sink to increase the life time of MWSN. Path and location of the nodes are changing frequently in mobile WSN. So Swarm intelligence (group behaviour) is needed for the communication as well as on data collection, Query publication and intrusion detection. To operate MWSNs in a secure way, intrusions should be detected before attackers can harm the network. Intrusion can also occur in multiple layers of MWSN so continuous investigation of aggregated data to be needed. Proposed work is for SIDI (Swarm Intelligence based Data aggregation for Intruder detection) raising the energy efficiency of a network. Simulation results indicate that this operation practically will increase the network lifetime.",

In order to implement these services, smart environments are equipped with several sensors that continuously monitor the activities performed by a user. Sensor data are activation sequences and could be seen as the execution of a process representing daily user behaviors and performed activities. In this paper we propose a methodology, which exploit Process Mining techniques to discover both the daily behavior model and macro activities models. The former represents the ``standard'' behavior of the user in the form of a process model. The latter is a set of process models representing the flow of sensors activations when given tasks or macro activities are performed.

abstract="Transport risks in supply chains have increasingly lead to significant capital losses. Insurance claims against such losses have grown accordingly, while simultaneous advances in technology lead to continuously larger volumes of data recorded. Traditional risk evaluation methods in insurance struggle to account for rising supply chain complexity which is reflected by growing amount and dimensionality of supply chain data. Therefore decision-makers in the transport insurance industry need new ways of appropriate knowledge representation to support transport insurance providers with daily tasks such as premium tariffing. This paper presents a method based on multidimensional scaling (MDS) for the identification of groups of similar claims as a first step towards the improvement of supply chain risk evaluation and forecasting. We show the application potential of transforming and visualising transport damage claims data as the basis for developing decision support systems (DSS) to support transport insurance providers in tasks such as premium tariffing as well as transport and supply chain managers in risk mitigation and prevention activities.",

Specifically, we are interested in the boundaries of a shape in which all the sensors' readings satisfy a certain criteria. Given the evolution of the underlying sensed phenomenon, the boundaries of the shape(s) will also evolve over time. To avoid constantly updating the individual sensor-readings to a dedicated sink, we propose a distributed methodology where the accuracy of the answer is guaranteed within probabilistic bounds. We present linguistic constructs for the user to express the desired probabilistic guarantees in the query's syntax, along with the corresponding implementations.

abstract="Currently, national teenagers' physical qualities slump sharply; therefore, traditional physical activities and teaching methods cannot achieve satisfying results limited by time and space. Under such a condition, it can make breakthroughs to introduce computer simulation techniques. The computer simulation technology can establish a simulated physical activity through building a simulative system in vision, hearing and other aspects. Through simulated activities, such a technology can avoid the imbalance of time and space, as well as teach students according to their own characteristics so as to improve the feasibility and effectiveness of activities. This work introduces the application of computer simulation in physical education from its features and functions, as well as analyzes conditions that may occur during physical activities and computer simulation techniques by examples. The work provides a solution after analyzing and interpreting a typical case in the final part, as well as analyzes advantages and application points of the simulation technology considering general problems in physical education. The result shows that the simulation technology can be applied in physical education and provides valuable references.",

abstract="Reprogramming is an important function required by wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Due to the openness of WSNs, more and more researchers pay attention to the security aspect of reprogramming, but confidentiality is often ignored in this process. However, in some special applications such as battlefield, sending messages demand high levels of confidentiality. Several protocols address this issue, but they use relatively complex cryptography methods, which consume more computational resources and energy. Moreover, those approaches require packets arrive at the receiver in order. However, out-of-order tolerance is often a required feature in some harsh environment. In this paper, we propose an efficient scheme to ensure confidentiality of reprogramming and out-of-order packet delivery can be tolerated. To enhance the confidentiality of code image, we design an encode-then-encrypt scheme. To mitigate the DoS attacks against digital signature packets, we provide an energy-efficient mechanism.",

abstract="As a special kind of application of wireless sensor networks, Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have broad perspectives especially in clinical caring and medical monitoring. Big data acquired from BSNs usually contain sensitive information, which are compulsory to be appropriately protected. However, previous methods overlooked the privacy protection issue, leading to privacy violation. In this paper, a differential privacy protection scheme for big data in body sensor network is proposed. We introduce the concept of dynamic noise thresholds which makes our scheme more suitable for processing big data. It can ensure privacy during the whole life cycle of the data, which makes privacy protection for big data in BSNs promising. Extensive experiments are conducted to outline the merits of our scheme. Experimental results reveal that our scheme has higher level of privacy protection. Even in the case where the attacker has full background knowledge, it still provides sufficient ambiguity, which ensures being unable to match people based on the ECG data characteristic so as to preserve the privacy.",

abstract="Traditional data gathering protocols in wireless sensor networks are mainly based on static sink, and data are routed in a multi-hop manner towards sink. In this paper, we proposed a location predictable data gathering protocol with a mobile sink. A sink's location prediction principle based on loose time synchronization is introduced. By calculating the mobile sink location information, every source node in the network is able to route data packets timely to the mobile sink through multi-hop relay. This study also suggests a dwelling time dynamic adjustment method, which takes the situation that different areas may generate different amount of data into account, resulting in a balanced energy consumption among nodes. Simulation results show that our data gathering protocol enables data routing with less data transmitting time delay and balance energy consumption among nodes.",

More concretely, we extend existing security models with the requirement of aggregate unforgeability. Moreover, we instantiate an efficient protocol for private and unforgeable data aggregation that allows the Aggregator to compute the sum of users' inputs without learning individual values and constructs a proof of correct computation that can be verified by any third party.

abstract="In a multi-party business process, the choreography defines the conversational protocol among the parties, so that the visibility of the parties' private processes is limited to the set of operations required to respect such a protocol. Especially in scenarios where physical resources are exchanged, knowing how a resource owned by a party is managed in the premises of another party is not possible. Thus, possible misalignments can be detected too late. At the same time, IoT is increasingly adopted to enact business processes in many domains: e.g., logistics, manufacturing, healthcare. As, with IoT, smart devices can physically flow through the different parties involved in a process, their sensing capabilities can be exploited to improve the process compliance checking. With this work we propose an approach for compliance checking that mixes commitments and smart devices. Commitments, declaratively defining mutual contractual relationships between parties, drive the configuration of smart devices that, flowing along with the process flow, check their satisfaction and, in case of misalignment, timely inform the involved parties.",

abstract="Existing solutions yet for time synchronization in sensor networks are not resilient to malicious behavior from external attackers or internally compromised nodes. The feasibility of a pulse-delay attack (external attack), whereby an attacker can introduce arbitrarily long delays in the packet propagation time directly can affect the achieved synchronization precision. It is assumed in the proposed approach that all nodes are directly connected to one another. Hence, propagation delay is minimal. The proposed approach is able to overcome from external as well as internal attacker problems in group synchronization. The external attacks are resolved with the help of message authentication codes (MAC) and the use of private keys and internal attacks are found out on the basis of send and receive time. Once the group is secure from external as well as internal attacker i.e., no malicious node is present in the group then each node synchronizes to the common clock in the group.",

abstract="The cotton crop is one of the maximum crucial cash crops among India. Plant diseases are generally due to pest insect and pathogens and every year reduce the productiveness to huge scale if not managed within time. When farmers observe that crop is infected, they detect the disease by naked eyes and decide the pesticide as solution by their previous experience. It is not the accurate way and instead of increasing crop production, they become responsible for the loss of production due to use of wrong pesticide in large quantity. So it is very essential to use automatic system for cotton leaf disease detection. This paper proposed such a system for diagnosis as well as controlling of disease infection on cotton leaves together with soil quality monitoring. The present system uses a support vector machineÂ classifier for recognition of five cotton leaf diseases, i.e., Bacterial Blight, Alternaria, Gray Mildew, Cereospra, and Fusarium wilt. After disease detection, the name of a disease with its remedies is given to the farmers using Android app. The Android app is also used to display the soil parameters values inclusive of humidity, moisture, and temperature along with the water degree in a tank. By using Android app, farmers can ON/OFF the relay to control the motor and sprinkler in order to achieve crop suitable environment or to spray pesticides. All this leaf disease detection system and sensors for soil quality monitoring are interfaced with the usage of Raspberry Pi, which makes it impartial and price powerful system. This system shows the overall accuracy of 83.26{\%} for disease detection.",

This advancement has opened a door for researchers to work in the area of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) for use in a broad array of real-life applications. An enormous number of remotely deployed autonomous sensors gather data from their vicinity and communicate it to the base station after processing. The sensors communicate through some wireless strategies governed by routing protocols, which has a great impact on the performance of sensor networks. With this insight, we extensively surveyed routing protocols for WSNs. The network structure leads to the broad classification of WSNs' protocols in three foremost classes: flat, hierarchical, and location based routing. Cluster-based routing provides certain advantages over others like scalability, increased network lifetime and efficient data aggregation. In this work, we study and provide a detailed survey of famous hierarchical routing protocols, a taxonomy of hierarchical routing protocols along with the design challenges and also present a comparative analysis based on their traits and limitations.",

In this paper, an innovative method named Self-adaptive Entropy Wavelet (SEW) is proposed to detect incipient transverse crack faults on rotating shafts. Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is applied to obtain optimized wavelet function using impulse modelling and decompose a signal into multi-scale wavelet coefficients. Dominant features are then extracted from those vectors using Shannon entropy, which can be used to discriminate fault information in different conditions of shafts. Support Vector Machine (SVM) is carried out to classify fault categories which identifies the severity of crack faults. After that, the effectiveness of this proposed approach is investigated in testing phrase by checking the consistency between testing samples with obtained model, the result of which has proved that this proposed approach can be effectively adopted for fault diagnosis of the occurrence of incipient crack failures on shafts in rotating machinery.",

abstract="Human action recognition is an important yet challenging task. With the introduction of RGB-D sensors, human body joints can be extracted with high accuracy, and skeleton-based action recognition has been investigated and gained some success. In this paper, we split an entire action trajectory into several segments and represent each segment using covariance descriptor of joints' coordinates. We further employ the projective dictionary pair learning (PDPL) and majority-voting for multi-class action classification. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

abstract="Due to its enhanced accuracy and high-throughput capability in capturing genetic activities, recently Next Generation Sequencing technology is being applied prevalently in biomedical study for tackling diverse topics. Within the work, we propose a computational method for answering such questions as deciding optimal argument pairs (peak number, p-value threshold, selected bin size and false discovery rate) from estrogen receptor $\alpha$ ChIP-seq data, and detecting corresponding transcription factor binding sites. We employ a signal processing-based approach to extract inherent genomic features from the identified transcription factor binding sites, which illuminates novel evidence for further analysis and experimental validation. Thus eventually we attempt to exploit the potentiality of ChIP-seq for deep comprehension of inherent biological meanings from the high-throughput genomic sequences.",

abstract="Participatory sensing is an emerging paradigm in which citizens voluntarily use their mobile phones to capture and share sensed data from their surrounding environment in order to monitor and analyze some phenomena (e.g., weather, road traffic, pollution, etc.). Malicious participants can disrupt the system by contributing corrupted, fabricated, or erroneous data. Different trust and reputation systems have been proposed in literature to monitor participants' behavior and to estimate their honesty. A trust mapping function is exploited to assign a score to each contribution which reflects its quality as perceived by the application server. Thus, the application server can aggregate the data more accurately. In this paper, we compare different trust mapping functions and measure the accuracy of the aggregated data based on those functions.",

abstract="In this paper we consider Maximal Lifetime Coverage Problem in Wireless Sensor Networks which is formulated as a scheduling problem related to activity of sensors equipped at battery units and monitoring a two-dimensional space in time. The problem is known as an NP-hard and to solve it we propose two heuristics which use specific knowledge about the problem. The first one is proposed by us stochastic greedy algorithm and the second one is metaheuristic known as Simulated Annealing. The performance of both algorithms is verified by a number of numerical experiments. Comparison of the results show that while both algorithms provide results of similar quality, but greedy algorithm is slightly better in the sense of computational time complexity.",

abstract="In recent years, the major source of information leakage is due to insiders. In order to detect information leakage by some internal insiders, anomaly detection using individual and community behavior models have been developed. The basic assumption of anomaly detection is each user has his/her own profile of activities and anomaly detection algorithm attempts to identify any deviation from the basic profile by each user. Both models neglected the possibility of change of individual user profile, e.g. change of individual interests. We propose here an anomaly detection model of insider threat using file content. The proposed model uses the document segmentation and Naive Bayes algorithm to classify the contents of files in an organization. We then set up the correlation matrices between users and their interests, and also the user community and their interests. We then propose a comprehensive model to detect the insider threat, which takes into consideration of the deviations of individual users' current behaviors, their historical behaviors and their associated community behaviors simultaneously. According to the experimental test results, the proposed model can successfully detect the anomaly access to files in the internal systems.",

abstract="In this paper, a Coplanar Wave Guide (CPW)-Fed microstrip octagonal patch antenna for RFID Applications is proposed. The studied structure is suitable for 2.45/5.80Â GHz applications. The octagonal shape is obtained by making a cut in the four angles of the rectangular microstrip patch antenna; in addition the using of CPW-Fed allows obtaining UWB characteristics in the higher band. The miniaturization in the antenna size for lower band is achieved by introducing an inverted E slot in the radiating element. The proposed antenna is designed on a single and a small substrate board of dimensions 29.5Â {\texttimes}Â 29.5Â {\texttimes}Â 1.6 mm3. The simulated bandwidth of 5.73{\%} (2.37Â GHz to 2.51Â GHz) and 34.36{\%} (4.70Â GHz to 6.65Â GHz) is achieved for the lower band and the upper band, respectively. Moreover the miniaturized antenna has a good impedance matching and an enhanced gain. All the simulations were performed in CADFEKO, a Method of Moment (MoM) based solver.",

abstract="Maintenance of systems such as infrastructure, services and equipment on city context requires a complex management process in order to provide quality services, comply with regulations and extend lifespan of urban equipment and infrastructure without neglecting the proper use of resources to execute maintenance jobs. Cities can generate hundreds or thousands of maintenance jobs during a particular time period. These jobs can be generated automatically by equipment or can be reported by citizens/users. This work introduces a scheduling architecture for automatic management of maintenance jobs. The proposal is able to handle preventive and corrective maintenance jobs looking for available human and instrumental resources during the common time period required by the job to be executed. The scheduler uses intelligent strategies to satisfy constraints of each job in order to get a scheduling according to the criterion of the manager of maintenance. A case study is applied to smart city.",

abstract="In this paper, we present a contribution for the Single Source Shortest Path Problem (SSSPP) in large-scale graph with A* algorithm. A* is one of the most efficient graph traversal algorithm because it is driven by a heuristic which determines the optimal path. A* approach is not efficient when the graph is too large to be processed due to exponential time complexity. We propose a MapReduce-based approach called MRA*: MapReduce-A* which consists to combine the A* algorithm with MapReduce paradigm to compute the shortest path in parallel and distributed environment. We perform experiments in a Hadoop multi-node cluster and our results prove that the proposed approach outperforms A* algorithm and reduces significantly the computational time.",

This is particularly the case when ``Volunteered Data'' is registered in a standardized manner, interoperable with the data created by official institutions. The present work incorporates OpenStreetMap (OSM) and broadly accepted metadata-standards, that are controlled by scientific communities, to include the use of standardized interfaces for volunteered data contributions. An essential requirement for citizen science to operate, is the participation of the people. Spatial cognition is concerned with the acquisition, organization, employment, and examination of ``knowledge about spatial environments''. By this means ``knowledge about spatial environments'' is related to geographic proximity. Both OSM and metadata standards explore recent technologies for ``Semantic Web'' (SW) and ``Linked Open Data'' (LOD) enablement. The present study discusses the challenges and effects of standardized community contributions.",

In case of classification income is divided in Quintiles, which is used as a dependent variable for classification variable. Type of industry, education, age and occupation are found significant variables in both classification and regression tree. Regression trees shows that instead of education type of industry is the most important variable and sex and education are the least important variables. Classification tree also shows that Type of industry is the most significant variable which effects the earning of an individual, then age and occupation of an individual come and education is the least important variable where the rest of predictors play no role in earning of an individual.",
