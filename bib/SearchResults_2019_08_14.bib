abstract="An Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) environment is an integration of stand-alone assistive technologies, with elements of smart homes, and telehealth services. Successful development of this emerging technology will promote the ability for older people to live independently and age in place. This paper focuses on the socio-technical challenges associated with implementing the AAL market with specific reference to Canada. The strategy used to gather information was a case study design. Market facilitators include the vast Canadian geography, the number of older people living in rural communities, and the development of several provincial initiatives aimed at enabling seniors to remain independent. The principle of universality in Canada's healthcare system bodes well for these technologies, as AAL has the potential to assist in equalizing services to these communities. Barriers include fragmentation of the market, where in Canada more than 100 different health authorities serve individuals across ten provinces and three territories.",

abstract="SOPRANO (Service-oriented programmable smart environments for Older Europeans) is a EU-funded project to develop an ambient assisted living (AAL) system to enhance the lives of frail and disabled older people. SOPRANO uses pervasive technologies such as sensors, actuators, smart interfaces, and artificial intelligence to create a more supportive home environment. SOPRANO provides additional safety and security, supporting independent living and social participation and improving quality of life. The paper describes the user-driven approach to research and development within the SOPRANO project and presents results that have emerged from this iterative process. The paper concludes by discussing benefits of the user-driven approach and future plans for system demonstration and large-scale field trials.",

abstract="Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) systems integrate stand-alone assistive technologies with smart homes and telehealth. This paper reports on a study that focused on the envisioned impact of AAL systems on the lives of end-users using an alternate research approach. A qualitative design was used and semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 older adults in Southwestern British Columbia, Canada. While a high degree of acceptance regarding AAL was found in the present study, the research also discovered that such technologies have the potential to profoundly affect, both positively and negatively, participants meaning and experience of the home environment. These findings suggest that research and development paradigms need to be expanded if our intention is to produce a product that will be accepted and helpful to the end-user.",

We look to solve problems associated with heterogeneity, domain knowledge formalisation, low acceptance, integration and immaturity in the ambient assisted living domain. Our methodology consists of domain elicitation and modelling, needs elicitation and laddering, atomisation, recombination, and deployment and monitoring.",

abstract="The SOPRANO (Service-oriented programmable smart environments for Older Europeans) project was an EU-funded project to develop an ambient assisted living (AAL) system to enhance the lives of frail and disabled older people. A major aim of the project was to shift away from `technology-push' and `problem-focused' approaches to user-driven approaches and map out an AAL system that will provide practical benefits for users in their everyday lives. The SOPRANO project involved users at all stages in the iterative development of an AAL system. This paper presents the main findings from the study, reflects on the key challenges in adopting a user-centred approach, and identifies some of the barriers to the widespread implementation of AAL systems within the spectrum of care for older people.",

This paper aims to inform the intended readership about the status of research, programmes as well as actual efforts and challenges in the field of AAL. This report provides first the status of the problem as well as an overview of the AAL topics targeted by the European AAL Association and the European Commission.
