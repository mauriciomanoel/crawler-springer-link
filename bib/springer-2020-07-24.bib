abstract="A self-adaptive system (SAS) can reconfigure at run time in response to adverse combinations of system and environmental conditions in order to continuously satisfy its requirements. Moreover, SASs are subject to cross-cutting non-functional requirements (NFRs), such as performance, security, and usability, that collectively characterize how functional requirements (FRs) are to be satisfied. In many cases, the trigger for adapting an SAS may be due to a violation of one or more NFRs. For a given NFR, different combinations of hierarchically-organized FRs may yield varying degrees of satisfaction (i.e., satisficement). This paper presents Providentia, a search-based technique to optimize NFR satisficement when subjected to various sources of uncertainty (e.g., environment, interactions between system elements, etc.). Providentia searches for optimal combinations of FRs that, when considered with different subgoal decompositions and/or differential weights, provide optimal satisficement of NFR objectives. Experimental results suggest that using an SAS goal model enhanced with search-based optimization significantly improves system performance when compared with manually- and randomly-generated weights and subgoals.",

abstract="Requirements Engineering plays a crucial role in the software development process. Many works have pointed out that Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) are critical to the quality of software systems. NFRs, also known as quality requirements, can be difficult to elicit due to their subjective diversity nature. In this paper, we introduce the QR Framework which uses an ontology-based approach to support the collection of knowledge on possible solutions to implement NFRs, semi-automatically connecting related NFRs. Preliminary search mechanisms are provided in a tool to facilitate the identification of possible solutions to an NFR and their related consequences to other solutions and/or other NFRs. To evaluate whether our approach aids eliciting NFRs, we conducted a controlled experiment performing a software development scenario. Our results suggest that reusing NFR knowledge can drive software engineers to obtain a closer to complete set of possible solutions to address quality concerns.",

abstract="The existence of variations in the organizational environment makes the configuration of business process models a complex activity, even for experienced business analysts. The increasing adoption of business processes models by software engineers as a input for requirements analysis strengthens the importance of adressing this issue. The challenge is to configure business processes to fit the organization better. We propose an approach that combines variability analysis and non-functional requirements to drive the configuration of a business process. Applying this approach we can analyze variability in the model in order to assess the impact of the choices on the process quality constraints - the non-functional requirements. Moreover, it provides a rationale for the selection of a specific configuration.",

abstract="An increasing amount of today's software systems is developed by dynamically composing available atomic services to form a single service that responds to consumers' demand. These composite services are distributed across the network, adapted dynamically during run-time, and still required to work correctly and be available on demand. The development of these kinds of modern services requires new modeling and analysis methods and techniques to enable service reliability during run-time. In this paper, we define the required phases of the composite service design and execution to achieve reliable composite service. These phases are described in the form of a framework. We perform a literature survey of existing methods and approaches for reliable composite services to find out how they match with the criteria of our framework. The contribution of the work is to reveal the current status in the research field of reliable composite service engineering.",

abstract="At present, there are a large number of embedded systems (ES) which need to modify their behavior at run time in response to changing environmental conditions (sensor failures, noisy networks, malicious threats, unexpected input{\ldots}etc.) or in the cases where the requirements themselves needs to change. i.e. ES require self-adaptive capabilities. This kind of ES has been widely used in different domain, for instance in the smart home systems, automotive systems, telecommunication systems, environmental monitoring and others. Unfortunately, up to now, there are few researchers which interest for the high level design process of the self-adaptive embedded systems (SAES) specifically in the field of requirement engineering (RE). For this reason, the objectives of this paper is to try as much as possible to recall and compare between existing works build around the RE of SAES in the sake of identifying advantages and weak points of each work.",

abstract="Pervasive environments support users' daily routines in an invisible and unobtrusive way. To do so, they include a technical pervasive infrastructure, which is aware of and adaptive to both the operational context and the users at hand. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) have been effectively used to inform decision-making in software engineering: functional alternatives are compared in terms of their contribution to NFRs satisfaction. In this work, we consider user preferences over NFRs as a key driver for the adaptation of a pervasive infrastructure. We devise a model-driven framework for building pervasive systems that maximize fitness with the context and the user. Our contributions are: (i) adaptive task models, a conceptual model to describe user routines that accounts for user preferences over NFRs; and (ii) an adaptation framework, which uses our models at runtime to guide a pervasive infrastructure in adapting its behaviour to user preferences and context.",

abstract="A new theoretical framework for the conceptual modeling of personalized and context-aware systems is described which supports specification of customization for individual users and analyzing the interaction between the domain context and functionality. An initial taxonomy of models is proposed based on the concept of personalized requirements. Two layers of human-centric models are proposed: an individual user characteristics layer for adaptation in assistive technology, learning and learning support systems and an individual values and personal goals layer to tailor applications to personal requirements. Practical application of the modeling framework is illustrated in a healthcare case study of a personalized, self-adaptive context-aware system.",

abstract="Changing requirements are widely regarded as one of the most significant risks for software systems development. However, in today's business landscape, these changing requirements also represent opportunities to exploit new and evolving business conditions. In consonance with other agile methods, we advocate requirements engineering techniques that embrace and accommodate requirements change. This agile approach to requirements must nonetheless be systematic and incorporate some degree of planning, especially with respect to accommodating quality attributes such as safety and security. This chapter examines the nature of requirements evolution, and the two main problems that it entails. The first is to correctly understand what is changing in the requirements, that is, the elicitation problem. The other is to act on that new information using models and other representations of the requirements, influencing the architecture and implementation of the software system. This chapter first motivates the importance of considering changing requirements in evolving software systems. It then surveys historical and existing approaches to requirements evolution with respect to the elicitation and taking action problems. Finally, the chapter describes a framework for supporting requirements evolution, defining the Requirements Evolution Problem as finding new specifications to satisfy changed requirements and domain assumptions. To motivate this, we discuss a real-life case study of the payment card industry.",
